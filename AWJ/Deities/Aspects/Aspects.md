Aspects are people who have ascended into an incredibly powerful, immortal, transcendent state through becoming the physical embodiment of an idea or concept. 

As an Aspect, they have unique control of their specific embodiment, able to bless and curse people, places, and objects with the sentiment of their embodiment. 

However, this status only lasts for as long as the Aspect is true to their embodiment. Immediate demise awaits Aspects who lose sight of what they are.
