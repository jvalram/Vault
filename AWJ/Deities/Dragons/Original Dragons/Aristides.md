##### **WARMONGER ARISTIDES**

Aristides was the first earth [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

The largest of all the dragons, Aristides was a dragon whose presence commanded attention and inspired the fighting spirit in their people. 

Aside from being an incredible force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, Aristides was also hailed as being a great leader to their people, having successfully founded the nation of [[Terra|Breinia]]. 

As the nations ruler, Aristides was known for taking the time to make personal connections with their people, even going so far as to engage in pastimes with them. 

In order to better improve life for their people, Aristides began to rally their people to help in the expansion of Breinia outwards. Through the battles that occurred to bring Breinia more land, Aristides proved themself an incredible and dominating fighter, earning them the title of Warmonger amongst the people of Breinia. 

Although expansion of Breinia went smoothly for awhile due to Aristides strategic planning and sheer might, they would meet their match in their brother [[Hrærek]]. 

The two fought viciously over land. Their battles would all eventually lead up to the one fateful fight where Aristides had made the fatal decision to take a devastating assault of earth-shattering lightning bolts meant for a brigade of Aristides. 

Weakened from taking the full brunt of the attack, [[Hrærek]] managed to deal a killing blow to Aristides. Their body shook the earth violently as it fell to the ground, remaining for a moment before shattering into a flux of magical earth energy. 

The people of the now crumbling Breinia mourned Aristides greatly and swore to avenge their god.
