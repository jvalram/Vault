##### **SCHOLAR VASCO**

Vasco was the first mind [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

An inquisitive soul, Vasco often travelled wherever his curiosity took him. Although the people of the nation that was to become [[Pensier]] badgered him endlessly to serve as the leader of their newly forming nation given his immense amount of knowledge, Vasco refused. 

He was content to answer questions here and there, he had little interest in being heavily involved with the forming of the nation. Vasco thought of himself more of an observer to history rather than one who should influence it. 

Instead of a leader, Vasco was instead seen as the Scholar Who Witnesses All. Unique to Vasco was his tendency to venture outside of Pensier for extended amounts of time. 

An unheard of trait for a dragon, Vasco was known to not let his knowledge begin and end with Pensierâ€”he desired knowledge from every single crevice Mulvao had to offer. 

Vasco would come and go over the years, collecting knowledge across the world before staying within Pensier for a number of years to advise and inform the people before repeating the cycle all over again. His adventures would come to an abrupt end at the beginning of the [[World's Calamity]], Vasco rushing off to Pensier to valiantly defend the people. 

He would fight for years before being struck with a sudden epiphany and taking a final flight to [[A'lune]] to sacrifice himself in the [[Pool of Velesteus]] the sake of the world. 

Although none have seen Vasco or a successor to him since his noble sacrifice, hopeful whispers of him still roaming the world and collecting knowledge prevail today.
