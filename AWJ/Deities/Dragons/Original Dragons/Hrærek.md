##### **CONQUEROR HRÆREK**

Hrærek was the first lightning [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

Always crackling with a powerful energy that no one dared to challenge, Hrærek was and ambitious and prideful leader to the nation he would quickly found—[[Åskvädjr]]. With his sheer might and perfect control of the crackling skies, Hrærek easily conquered the wild and unruly lands of [[Åskvädjr]], paving the way for his people to rapidly build and flourish into the Grand Kingdom of Åskvädjr. 

With his unmatched power, Hrærek sought to expand his glorious kingdom by leading his people into battle to claim more land for Åskvädjr. Through these successful battles and raids, Hrærek became known as **The Conqueror**. 

Hrærek and his army were a nigh unstoppable force, plowing through the territories of his siblings and claiming more and more land with ease. His near match would come in the form of his sibling [[Aristides]]—the earth dragon. 

Whenever the two would meet on the battlefield with their respective armies, the wounds and casualties wrought from the battles would be remarkably high with no clear winner most times. However, in one fateful battle, Hrærek was able to get the upper hand in his fight with Aristides and slew his sibling. 

The people of Åskvädjr cheered as they continued to advance upon what was once Aristides's lands. Despite appearing to be a grand win at the time, the slaying of Aristides would be Hrærek's downfall. 

Hrærek's reckoning would come for him roughly 50 years later. With his conquest of Braudrica nearing completion save for the small nations of A'lune and Klorída along with small pockets of resistance from the crumbs of Aristides's people and the nearly conquered lands of [[Xuefeng]], Hrærek had grown comfortable and arrogant. 

The attitude would cost him his life during a fight with Xuefeng over the water dragon's last stretch of land. What Hrærek had not expected was an ambush from a surprise contender—[[Aristides]]'s progeny: [[Cratos]]. 

Hrærek put his all into defending himself, but found himself overwhelmed by the might of two dragons. Although managing to slay [[Xuefeng]] in the fight, Hrærek was ultimately killed by Cratos, shattering into a bright flux of magical lightning energy before his corpse could hit the ground. 

The army of [[Åskvädjr]] retreated with haste, in shock that their legendary god was now dead. To this day, the people of Åskvädjr cling to the hope that one day Conqueror Hrærek will return to bring Åskvädjr back to its former state of glory.
