##### **EXILE NARCISA**

Narcisa was the first fire [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

A self-interested perfectionist, Narcisa was quick to heed the call to the lands across the ocean that would beckon her to claim it. Too prideful to be seen directly associating with mortals she perceived as beneath her, Narcisa handpicked a family to install as royalty. 

This family would become the leaders of the new nation, guided by Narcisa behind closed doors. The system would work well to allow [[Umlilo]] to flourishâ€”for a time. 

As the years passed, Narcisa began to become more and more controlling of the puppets she had placed on the throne. She began to advise less and demand more, going so far as to even dictate the minute expressions and mannerisms the royal family should exhibit and force onto the people of Umlilo as a whole. 

Her domineering reign would come to an end when news of [[The Radiant Deliverance]] in the newly renamed nation of [[Nations/Mulvao/Aukamen/Raj/Raj|Raj]] came to [[Umlilo]]. 

As the tale began to spread, Narcisa feared the wildfire she could not control despite her best efforts to silence voices of dissent. Even though she knew it'd be a losing fight, she was much too prideful to leave her lair. 

When the inevitable coup lead by none other than the royal family arrived at her doorstep, Narcisa held her ground and fought. In the bloody battle that ensued, Narcisa burned through scores and scores of people, cackling at the weak retaliation the coup offered. 

The tables would turn when Narcisa set the Queen of Umlilo aflame in a hellish inferno. From the Queen's ashes, a majestic bird of pure fire rose and lead the charge against Narcisa once more. 

The peoples' spirits reinvigorated as more phoenix began to rise from the ashes of the people Narcisa had burned, Narcisa found herself beaten, bruised, humiliated, and defeated. 

Rather than execute her for what she had done, the new Queen of Umlilo decided to exile Narcisa instead. Death, she felt, would be too kind of a punishment. 

Narcisa took off with her tail between her legs, never to be seen again.
