##### **PRIMARCH SESUR-SATI**

Sesur-sati was the first sun [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

A radiant dragon that oozed a natural charisma and a strong ambition for a bright future, Sesur-sati was quick to establish the nation of Sesur with himself as its leaderâ€”the Primarch. 

As Primarch, Sesur-sati did a great job of establishing the cornerstones of his nation with his thought out planning that the nations of Sesur would execute to a T. 

This easy obedience from the people allowed Sesur to quickly rise as one of the most prominent nations of the early [[New World]]. 

Sesur-sati's sheer blinding power also allowed his nation to rise as a dominant nation of [[Aukamen]] as Sesur-sati proved strategically efficient in not only defending his nation's borders, but expanding and claiming new land beyond them too. 

As a reward for enabling his nation to flourish, Sesur-sati began to divert the nation's resources away from itself towards him. As time passed, Sesur-sati's pride for his nation turned into vanity; his power into wrath. 

The people of Sesur began to suffer under his rule, the infrastructure and welfare of the nation taking a major backseat to the grand palaces and statues Sesur-sati was commissioning for himself. 

The people begged for a savior to rid them of the conceited tyrant their Primarch had become. A savior would come in the form of the sun itselfâ€”[[Deities/Gods/Raj|Raj]]. With Raj's help, the people of Sesur overthrew Sesur-sati and slew him. The people cheered as Sesur-sati's fallen corpse shattered into a flux of magical sun energy.
