##### **SAINT CONSTANCE**
Constance was the first moon [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

A caring soul, Constance was often her siblings' keeper up until the time they all started departing to follow the calls that beckoned them elsewhere. For Constance, that call remained right here in the remnants of [[Rauceveth]]. 

The people of Rauceveth were looking for change as the masses left. A change that would put this nation on a new, bright future. For this, they looked to none other than Constance herself—a figure not only revered for her status as a dragon, but her status as a priestess of [[Velesteus]]. 

Swept up in her soothing nature and radiant divinity, the people looked to Constance for guidance. Under her advisory and thoughtful eye, the archaic nation of [[Rauceveth]] transformed into the flourishing nation [[A'lune]]. 

The quickly nation revitalized, the people of [[A'lune]] put Constance on even more of a pedestal. 

In no time at all, Constance found herself both leading the [[Church of Velesteus]] and A'lune as a whole. 

Although reluctant to wield so much power, the infighting between her siblings in the land south of her made her hold her ground. As much as it pained her to hear of the violent war—a war that would later go down in history as the "[[Genesi of Braudrica]]"—, Constance had her beloved people to protect should the war ever reach A'lune's doorsteps. 

Thankfully, it never did. As time on, Constance's never aging appearance began to become the hot topic of the nation. A further confirmation of divinity. Proof that she was a goddess equal to [[Velesteus]]. 

The whispers and rumors unsettled Constance. She had always claimed to not be Velesteus's equal, but as time passed, the people began to suspect her words were simply that of humility. 

Only 6 years after the [[Genesi of Braudrica]] came to an end, Constance would officially and publicly step down from her position. In her wake, she would leave an item the Church would treasure dearly—her egg. 

This retirement ceremony would be the last time anyone saw Constance.
