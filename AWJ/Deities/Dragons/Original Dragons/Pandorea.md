##### **ALLMOTHER**
AKA [[Mother Pandorea]] / [[Allmother]]

Pandorea was the first flora [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]]. 

A kind and nurturing soul, Pandorea was special in that she maintained a close and personal relationship with the people who would follow her lead in establishing the humble nation of [[Klorída]]. 

Pandorea was revered for being a benevolent and personal goddess to the people, often taking the form of a witch to walk amongst her people and come down to their humble level. 

She made genuine connections with the people of her small nation and did everything in her power to ensure the happiness of all. For her loving care, the people of [[Klorída]] dubbed her [[Mother Pandorea]]. 

However, her time with her beloved nation and people would be cut relatively short by the start of the [[Genesi of Braudrica]]—a war started by her brothers in a violent race to claim as much land as possible. 

[[Klorída]] found itself caught in the crossfire, people and nature alike being destroyed at a rate Pandorea could not keep up with. Instead of trying to fight off her stronger brothers, Pandorea chose to sacrifice herself. 

She fused herself into the heart of Klorída's land, becoming Klorída itself. Through her sacrifice, the flora of Klorída became heavily infused with magic, empowering it to the point of becoming alive and animated. 

The flora of Klorída became the nation's protector, successfully fending off all threats to the nation's land and people. To this day, the people of Klorída still hold their [[Allmother]] Pandorea in the highest regard as the nurturing goddess of flora.
