### ||Waatiq||, Dragon of Celestial Magic

Location: [[Kalawakan Islands]]
Magic: #celestial

||Waatiq|| is the only currently living [[Original Dragons|original dragon]]. 

Any and all mention/memory of ||Waatiq|| does not exist in [[Mulvao]] as a result of ||Waatiq's|| request to their closest sibling, [[Vasco]]. 

||Waatiq|| resides in the [[Kalawakan Islands]], a nation that exists in a pocket dimension that is solely original Kalawakan Islands cut out of [[Mulvao]]. 

||Waatiq|| is just sulking and moping for eternity on the islands – the ppl that inhabit the islands an unintended consequences when ||Waatiq|| literally just kind cut and pasted the islands from the main world into a pocket dimension created by their own magic. They have little to no interest in the ppl they've unintentionally trapped with them in their self imposed eternal prison.

People managed to stumble upon their lair and have not stopped bothering them since, so ||Waatiq|| settled for paying them a lick of attention regarding whatever the people deemed "important matters" in return for the ppl leaving them alone the majority of the time.

One such "important matter" are ppl that group find problematic or unsavory--usually due to their magic or questioning ||Waatiq's|| greatness (which ||Waatiq|| themselves could literally not give 2 shits abt). Their simple solution? Eject them from this pocket dimension and back out into the main world. 

||Waatiq|| doesn't know what the current state of the main world is. Doesn't know if their moms are still alive or if their siblings are still out there. If they are, ||Waatiq|| doesn't want them coming to find them. If they aren't, ||Waatiq|| still wants to remain in this solitary prison with no outside interference. 

So, ||Waatiq|| curses all those the little council bring to them before ejecting them out into the main world. ||Waatiq|| has no real problem doing this as it gets the council off their back and they don't really care abt the ppl living on the islands – they just want to be left alone for eternity
#### Early Life

Before they were wiped from all mention and memory, ||Waatiq|| was the 12th dragon egg gifted to [[Aurore]] and [[Princess Hozumi]]. He was the runt of the litter, shoved around a lot by his siblings [[Aristides]] and [[Hrærek]]. 

||Waatiq|| was very close with [[Vasco]] and was generally non-confrontational, easy to manipulate, and always believed the best in everyone. 
#### The Great Migration

During [[The Great Migration]], those with the same magical as their dragon would follow them to whichever nation their magic led them to. The people who joined ||Waatiq|| were all cruel and depraved, people who belonged in the deepest layer of hell. All capable of celestial magic. 
#### Praerror

These people forced ||Waatiq|| deep into a catacomb and enacted horrors onto them that dubbed the catacomb "The Catacombs of Pain & Terror." These actions caused ||Waatiq|| to hold a great hatred for all of humanity.

All who harmed ||Waatiq|| in the catacomb remained there and may still be there today, as time works differently in the catacomb. 

A result of one of these depraved actions was a new celestial egg that resides deep within the catacomb. It's responsible for keeping the celestial magic going strong this whole time. 

[[Vasco]], ||Waatiq||'s closest sibling, came to visit and asked what he could do to help. ||Waatiq|| merely asked to be erased from [[Mulvao|Mulvao's]] memory, for there to be no mention of them in any record.  

[[Vasco]] was reluctant, but did as requested. After the events of [[World's Calamity]], [[Vasco]] died, along with the last memory anyone held of ||Waatiq||
