##### **VALKYRIE INGULFRID**

Ingulfrid was the first ice [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

She, along with several powerful ice witches and frost giants, came together to found the nation of [[Kjølik]].

Initially acting as more of an advisor for the nation's elected leaders, Ingulfrid to be  empathetic and strong. She was known to hear out the problems of the people and do what she could to help. 

Ingulfrid was also a marvel to watch in battle, helping her people settle the frosty wildlands through great shows of combat against rivaling hostile monsters. Through these glorious battles, Ingulfrid earned her title as Valkyrie and given full reign of [[Kjølik]]. 

For the next several centuries, her strength was an inspiration to the warriors of Kjølik. As time went on, she was praised more and more as an icon of power. Her own hold on ice began to grow stronger and stronger, leaking out beyond her body and into the world itself. 

This excess of magic sent [[Kjølik]] into a deep freeze like never before—a deathly freeze that would claim hundreds of thousands. When asked about it, Ingulfrid would get defensive and snap, leading her people to believe her rightfully guilty for this tragic hardship. 

The peoples' image of their goddess rapidly began to deteriorate. No longer was this the Valkyrie Ingulfrid—Kjølik's champion with a warm heart surprising for a dragon made of ice. Rather, some twisted and mad imposter now stood in her place, entrapping any who dared to so much as breathe against her in nevermelt ice. 

To slay a dragon, however, would not be a simple task by any means. The peoples' opportunity came when Ingulfrid was spotted flying to her lair one fateful day, incredibly wounded and weak. 

With a fierce rally calling for liberation, the people of [[Kjølik]] shot at Ingulfrid. They were successful in their endeavor, fatally wounding Ingulfrid. The people watched as she gave one final cry before dissipating into pure condensed magical ice energy that settled like snow over Kjølik.
