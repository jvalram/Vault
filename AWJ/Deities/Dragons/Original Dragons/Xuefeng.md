### **EMPEROR XUEFENG**

Xuefeng was the first water [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

An inquisitive soul, Xuefeng's natural curiosity and shrewdness lent itself to be a tremendous boon in exploring the land that called people there. As both lands and sea began to become settled with the aid of Xuefeng, the people decided to crown their god Emperor of [[Shuǐeh]]. 

With Xuefeng as Emperor, the nation of Shuǐeh flourished with the dragon's innovative ideas and mastery of the surrounding ocean, allowing Shuǐeh's borders to expand beyond the coastal shores. 

[[Shuǐeh]] would enjoy this era of discovery and prosperity until war began to knock on its doorstep in the form of [[Aristides]] and their army. 

Knowing the oceans of Shuǐeh were nigh unconquerable to their other draconic siblings, Xuefeng put up little fight against [[Aristides]], slowly conceding land bit by bit in exchange for the lives of Shuǐeh's people. 

This solution to the encroachment of Shuǐeh would not last long. By the time news of Aristides death to the claws of [[Hrærek]] reached Xuefeng, Hrærek's armies were already at Shuǐeh's borders with no intent to negotiate—only conquer. 

Xuefeng was forced into action, entering the battlefield proper to do what they could. Despite Xuefeng's mastery in their magic, the only wins Xuefeng could manage were those that were absent of Hrærek's presence. 

As the years went on and Shuǐeh's land borders began to shrink and shrink, Xuefeng was eventually gifted an opportunity to turn the situation around in the surprise arrival of Aristides's progeny: [[Cratos]]. 

The young earth dragon proposed a plan to ambush Hrærek on the battlefield. He was confident that the two of them together would be enough to end Hrærek's reign on terror on [[Braudrica]]. With not much more to risk, Xuefeng agreed to Cratos's plan. 
#### **Death of Xuefeng**
The next battle on the border where Hrærek arrived, [[Cratos]] ambushed Hrærek. Both water and earth dragons fought viciously against the Conqueror, giving their absolute all. 

Xuefeng's all was enough to cripple Hrærek, but not enough to save their own life as Xuefeng fell to the same claw their sibling did, body softly dissipating into a flux of magical water energy. 

The people of Shuǐeh hold their original Emperor in high regards for not only showing the bounty of the ocean to the people, but for their sacrifice that saved Shuǐeh.
