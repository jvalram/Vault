##### **INVENTOR GRIMA**

Grima was the first creation [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

Always interested in innovation and progression, Grima sought to create a bright future for the people that followed them to the land that would eventually become [[Erzeung]]. 

Upon arrival to the new land, Grima quickly took to inventing alongside the people—constructing the foundations of the roads, buildings, tools, transportation, and innovations that would see Erzeung quickly rising to the most technologically advanced nation in all of [[Mulvao]]. 

Although the people of Erzeung had begged for the Grand Inventor to lead their nation, Grima had refused. Politics were of little interest to them—the only matter that concerned them was the continued innovation of their projects. 

So, Grima was instead relegated the title of "[[Grima|Grand Inventor]]", overseeing the research and development process behind the inventions that would serve to continue Erzeung's prosperous state. 

The inventions would come to an abrupt halt at the beginning of [[World's Calamity]]. Throughout that dark era, Grima would put their greatest effort into defending the people of Erzeung for many years before being struck with a sudden epiphany and taking a final flight to [[A'lune]] to sacrifice themself in the [[Pool of Velesteus]] the sake of the world. None have seen a whisper of Grima or a successor to them since their noble sacrifice.
