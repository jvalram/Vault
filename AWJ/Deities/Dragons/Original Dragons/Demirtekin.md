##### **NOMAD DEMIRTEKIN**

Demirtekin was the first air [[Dragons|dragon]] born into existence / one of the [[original dragons]].

In tune with the winds since their youth, Demirtekin was the first of the dragons to leave home and set out for new lands. Along the journey, Demirtekin took a casual pleasure in getting to know the people who felt the same calling of the winds southward. 

Upon the arrival of their collective destination, Demirtekin had learned something about themself. Their place was not here on land—it was in the skies. 

With this knowledge, Demirtekin bid all who had travelled with them good luck on their endeavors of building a nation and took off high into the skies, but not without first offering something—a gift to those who could visit. 

The very few who were able to reach such astronomical heights were indeed gifted—a capability to perform magic on levels untold. Demirtekin would constantly remain up in the skies and out of view of the common person save for two instances. 

The first, Demirtekin had descended to the heights of the [[Cruel Mountains]] after a 100 years since their leave to inquire about the state of the world. Evidently distraught to learn of most of their siblings' fates, Demirtekin quickly returned to the skies. 

The second time was the coming of [[World's Calamity]] when Demirtekin descended once more to fight to protect the people of [[Hava]] before being struck with a sudden epiphany and taking one final flight to [[A'lune]] to sacrifice themself in the [[Pool of Velesteus]] the sake of the world. 

Since that noble sacrifice, the skies of [[Hava]] remained without a dragon until 50 years later when a harpy claimed to have seen the great dragon roaming the skies once more. 

Since then, a handful of people strong enough to reach such heights have also claimed the same—that Demirtekin had beaten the odds. Even better, Demirtekin still seemed to keep their eternal promise of a gift to those who strong enough to meet them face to face. 

To this day, Demirtekin is known to fly above Hava, bestowing great power onto those who can say hello.
