Following the split of [[Phiclai]] from the rebirth of the world, the lands of [[Mulvao]] found themselves to be imbued heavily with the new elemental magic types. 

Alongside the lands, a sentient embodiment of the each new elemental magic type, the [[Dragons|dragons]], were introduced to Mulvao, each one also possessing an extreme amount of magical energy.

Up until 100 NW, the sheer amount of magical energy that flowed through the lands was powerful enough that people who were able to use magic found themselves stricken with a visceral/physical urge to travel to the source of the magic that matched their own magic type, whether that be an urge to move to the land itself or follow the dragon that also seemed to be migrating to the land that matched its elemental type.

This migration is attributed to the reason why most magic users within a nation, even to this day, more likely than not, share the same element of magic as the land.
