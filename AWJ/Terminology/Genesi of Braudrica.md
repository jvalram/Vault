> A war between [[Hrærek]] and [[Aristides]] over land they once shared. The war would reach a stalemate, each battle ending in victory for one side and the next favoring the other. Neither kingdom could seem to gain a decisive advantage.

When the world was reborn in 0 NW, [[The Great Migration]] began. It called for people blessed with magic to travel the lands in search of new homelands. In the year 20 NW, all of the dragons, except for [[Constance]] who chose to remain behind, set forth from [[Rauceveth]] to answer the same call.

As embodiments of magic itself, the [[Dragons]] possessed a natural, charismatic pull that enticed travelers and settlers alike, guiding those headed to the same homeland.

For the next thirty five years, nations across Mulvao laid the foundation of their new societies, heavily benefiting from the guidance and wisdom of their respective dragons.

As these new nations developed on the continent of [[Braudrica]], the desire for more land fueled rising tensions, especially between the Kingdom of [[Åskvädjr]] and the Kingdom of [[Terra|Breinia]], pushing them towards conflict. [[Hrærek]], the assertive dragon king of Åskvädjr known for his bold strategies, and [[Aristides]], the steadfast dragon monarch of Breinia famed for their relentless ambition, were both the most aggressive leaders in Braudrica. 

> They highly valued power and strength and aimed to establish their respective nations as the most formidable military and political forces in Braudrica. 

To achieve this, the initial development period for these two nations concentrated on territorial expansion. By 35 NW, Breinia and Åskvädjr had solidified into kingdoms that, together, controlled roughly 55% of the continent's landmass. 

Despite holding the majority of the land, both dragon monarchs still yearned for more territory. Scouting parties and settlers from both nations often clashed in small skirmishes over unclaimed lands, each seeking to expand their nation's territories.

The tensions would come to a head over a particular lush and resource-rich land that had previously been determined to be neutral grounds to be shared between Breinia and Åskvädjr. By 55 NW, every other neutral territory had been claimed by either Breinia or Åskvädjr, leaving no space unoccupied. **This land marked the final piece of claimable territory and both dragons desperately sought to claim it for their kingdoms.**

Hungry for the land, [[Aristides]] and [[Hrærek]] gathered their warriors to personally claim the land as their own. However, upon arrival, both parties would not just see the land they wished to claim, but the enemy on the other side with the same intention. Equally enraged at each other's blatant betrayal of the agreement for the land to remain neutral, a fierce and immediate battle exploded between both parties. 

Earth and lightning clashing as the air filled with the roars of warriors and dragons. This first battle, won by [[Hrærek]] and his warriors, ignited a long series of conflicts that escalated into the war known as **The Genesi of Braudrica**.  
  
Over the next five years, the land was ravaged by relentless battles along the borders, leaving a trail of bloodshed and strife across Braudrica's frontiers. The war would reach a stalemate, each battle ending in victory for one side and the next favoring the other. Neither kingdom could seem to gain a decisive advantage.

Facing frustration from the deadlock, both monarchs ordered their armies to push southward—seeking new lands, resources, and a chance to break the stalemate. To the south of each of their kingdoms laid a territory they sought to conquer. 

For Monarch Aristides: [[Shuǐeh]]. 

For King Hrærek: [[Klorída]].

Åskvädjr's push into Klorída was a violent one. While Klorída had been nervously watching the war between Åskvädjr and Breinia unfold, they attempted to bolster their defenses in case the battles began to spill into Klorídan territory. Ultimately, though, their preparations proved inadequate for the scale and ferocity of Åskvädjr's assault. 

In a surprise move, the Åskvädjian army struck Klorída's southeastern border, sweeping through the Klorídan defense in a devastating blitz. Countless lives were lost in the initial surprise assault led by Hrærek himself. 

The devastating losses suffered by [[Klorída]] in this battle were a resounding win for [[Åskvädjr]]. Emboldened by their initial victory, the Åskvädjian forces continued their relentless invasion, overwhelming the ill-prepared Klorídans and rapidly conquering large swaths of their southern neighbor's territory.

For the next three years, [[Åskvädjr]] relentlessly clawed its way northward through [[Klorída]], leaving a path of destruction in its wake as it seized territory. Klorída was forced to shrink into a small corner of the east coast. While Klorída had managed to raise its own forces to stave off Åskvädjr's, these forces ultimately only served to slow Åskvädjr's advance—the enemy's army was superiorly trained and experienced.

The leader of Klorída, the flora dragon [[Pandorea]], was no fighter—her strength lay in nurturing and protecting her people and the land. When Pandorea could make an appearance on a battlefield, she commanded the forests to awaken and fervently fend off the Åskvädjians long enough to either ensure a complete retreat of her forces if the battle seemed dire or to inspire her troops with renewed vigor to turn the tide of the battle and hold their ground. 

**More often than not, however, battles between the two forces would result in a resounding loss for Klorída.**

When the Åskvädjian forces began to march on the capital, [[Lapicos]], with King [[Hrærek]] at the helm, [[Pandorea]] knew this was no fight to retreat from. Pandorea and her people would have to hold their ground and win this battle regardless of the odds stacked against them. 

The ensuing battle for Lapicos was a gruesome clash. Although the Klorídans fought with all of their might and soul, they were ultimately no match for Hrærek and his army.

Facing overwhelming odds and the imminent fall of her capital, Pandorea realized the only way to save her people and lands was through the ultimate sacrifice. Acting quickly, she channeled all of her remaining magic into the land itself, fusing her entire life force with the very soil and roots of Klorída. In doing so, Pandorea's physical form shattered into a bright flux of magical flora energy that seeped right into the flora all around. 

Absorbing the immense influx of new and potent magical energy, the forests arose with a renewed vigor and resoundingly drove back the invading forces, including Hrærek himself.

>The newly awakened flora, imbued with Pandorea's life force, would remain empowered, the now breathing lands of Klorída seemingly taking on a state of **semi-consciousness**. 

When Åskvädjian forces later returned for another attempt to overtake the capital, they would be soundly defeated at the borders by the flora of Klorída itself. With the life force of a dragon coursing through every root, stalk, and leaf, the natural flora transformed into an unyielding, living barrier. 

Vines ensnared, thorns pierced, and trees shifted their weight, creating an impenetrable guard that turned the borders of Klorída into a deadly maze for any outsider who dared approach for even in this form, the land recognized those who belonged to it. Even [[Hrærek]], a seasoned warrior and king, found his attacks rendered ineffective against the now empowered Klorídan flora, each attempt to breach their leafy defenses proving a frustrating and futile endeavor.

Taking the defeat for what it was, [[Åskvädjr]] ceased any campaigns to further conquer Klorídan territory, pivoting their expansion efforts to focus on the main battlefront with Breinia while still maintaining control over the already conquered Klorídan territory. 

However, over the course of the following years, Åskvädjr would be forced to concede bits and pieces of conquered territory as Klorída's expanding forests began to reclaim what was once their own.

While [[Terra|Breinia]]'s push into [[Shuǐeh]] was not nearly as violent as Åskvädjr's push into Klorída, Shuǐeh still experienced its own devastating losses. Much like Klorída did, Shuǐeh began preparing its own defenses against Breinia when war initially broke out between Breinia and Åskvädjr. 

Shuǐeh's leader and Emperor, the water dragon [[Xuefeng]], was much more strategically minded and battle proficient than their sister, [[Pandorea]]. As such, the army and defenses they raised in potential response to a Breinian invasion was much more prepared than Klorída's. 

Despite this better preparation and military might, Shuǐeh's first line of defense still ultimately fell when Breinia made a surprise push into Shuǐeh's north border, but not without the Shuǐan forces putting up a fight. Losses were great on both side, but Breinia ended up coming out on top.

Unlike Åskvädjr's swift invasion of Klorída, Breinia's conquest of Shuǐeh was much more paced. Although outnumbered by Breinia's forces, Shuǐeh's troops could hold their own for much longer than Klorídan forces. 

So long as [[Aristides]] themself was not there to lead the charge into battle, Shuǐan forces would be able to at least take out a sizable portion of Breinian forces before falling. Victory for Shuǐeh was only assured when Emperor [[Xuefeng]] themself led the charge and Breinian forces were not being directly led by Aristides.

Unfortunately, Xuefeng could not be everywhere all at once. Losses outnumbered wins. Slowly but surely, Shuǐeh was forced to concede its land to the dominating Breinia.

Nine years into the invasion of Shuǐeh, Breinia was preparing to march on [[Qingdao]], the capital of [[Shuǐeh]]. Xuefeng and their forces were armed and ready to defend the capital. However, the anticipated push from Breinia never happened, leaving the defenders of Qingdao tense and uncertain. 

Through scouts and spies, Xuefeng would come to learn that the reason for the retreat was the failed arrival of [[Aristides]] who was supposed to lead their troops. It wouldn't be until later that Xuefeng would learn of why Aristides failed to arrive.

A little while before the Breinian march on Qingdao was supposed to occur, Aristides and Hrærek stood on opposing sides of a vast, contested plain bordering Breinia and Åskvädjr. 

A tense silence hung in the air as each side sized the other up before the roars of both dragons heralded their armies to charge.

The ground trembled under Aristides' command, spikes of earth and stone rupturing forth to impale and disrupt Åskvädjr's forces. Hrærek retaliated with volleys of lightning that shattered the earthen defenses and sent Breinian soldiers scattering. The two armies clashed brutally with flint, steel, and magic, the dragons themselves locked in a grand duel. 

Aristides summoned great spears of stone to launch at Hrærek while also summoning grand walls to provide cover for both themself and their troops. Hrærek's thunderous lightning bolts tore through the sky with the intent to strike Aristides down and any Breinian that dared to try and divert his attention.

Amidst the chaos, Hrærek spotted a crucial opening—Aristides' attention was split between facing him and casting a complex spell to aggressively protect a flank of their army. Seizing the opportunity, Hrærek channeled an immense surge of lightning into a single devastating bolt aimed directly at Aristides.

Aristides, sensing the impending strike, attempted to erect a final, desperate barrier of stone. However, Hrærek's attack proved to be too powerful, shattering the earth shield and impaling Aristides straight through the chest.

All Aristides had the time for was to look down at the searing, gaping whole in their chest with a weak croak before shattering into a flux of magical earth energy. 

Hrærek roared in triumph, his lightning coursing over the battlefield as he and his reinvigorated forces pressed forward, decimating the remaining Breinian forces that attempted to make a hasty retreat while reeling from the sudden loss of their leader. 

Out of the entire force Aristides had brought with them, only one platoon made it out alive of the massacre of a battle—*spared by Hrærek's design so they could carry news of their monarch's defeat*. They were commanded to inform the people of Breinia that their monarch had fallen and that the Kingdom of Åskvädjr now demanded surrender—or promised conquest.

In the wake of Aristides' death, Åskvädjian forces launched a prolonged campaign to conquer Breinia and Shuǐeh completely. Despite the loss, Breinia's spirit was not broken. Military generals quickly convened as a war council, while nobles stepped forward to lead the nation in its time of crisis. 

However, the fiercely loyal generals warned the nobles that the crown would remain vacant until Aristides' progeny—a freshly hatched dragon born of an egg Aristides had left in their royal lair—could assume the crown. 

This new dragon, [[Cratos]], was raised in secret by the nobles and tutored in stratagems of warfare by generals passing through the capital while mobilizing troops. For the leaders of Breinia, it was crucial to raise Cratos into a formidable force capable of avenging his progenitor and restoring the glory of Breinia.

In the subsequent years, Åskvädjian forces advanced into Breinia's lands, pushing a path toward the northern border of Shuǐeh. Breinia's forces fought fiercely, making the path as difficult as possible for Åskvädjian troops to carve through their territory. 

To compensate for their lack of a war-ready dragon, the generals devised innovative war strategies that allowed their troops to hold the line against Åskvädjian attacks—occasionally even succeeding when Hrærek himself led the opposition. Though Breinia couldn't completely prevent Åskvädjian advances, the generals' strategic ingenuity prolonged the war for fifteen years—just long enough for the adolescent [[Cratos]] to conceive a plan to avenge his progenitor and ultimately crush Åskvädjr.

At the start of those fifteen years, Shuǐeh saw Breinia's aggressive expansion into their territory had ceased. The Breinian troops who were ready to march on Qingdao never returned. However, this did not mean that Breinia had entirely given up. 

With their whole attention shifted to Åskvädjr, the campaign to take Shuǐeh was put on pause. Any lands already under Breinian control would remain so—unless Shuǐeh dared to fight to reclaim them. 

Once [[Xuefeng]] became certain Breinia would not march on Qingdao per the reports their spies provided of Aristides's death, they began to prepare for a campaign to reclaim Shuǐeh's lost land. Only a week after the news was received did Xuefeng rally their troops to begin the fight to reclaim their land.

For the first month, Xuefeng and their army were successful in reclaiming parts of the territory to the east, taking the Breinian troops by surprise and expelling all settlers. Come the second month of the campaign, however, the Breinian troops had noticeably strengthened their defenses. Their defensive strategies had dramatically improved to the point where Xuefeng's presence alone was no longer a guarantee of a win—just a stalemate at the least. At this point, Xuefeng's campaign to reclaim all of Shuǐeh considerably slowed, but was still making progress.

By the seventh year, they had reclaimed all of the southwestern land that was taken. By the eleventh year, they had reclaimed a considerable portion of the eastern land. 

Before the campaign could continue, a Breinian messenger boy delivered an invitation to negotiate to Xuefeng. The invitation proposed a meeting of Xuefeng and the heir to the Breinian throne at the plains that both parties had been eyeing—Shuǐeh to reclaim and Breinia to defend. 

Although the possibility of it being a trap lingered in Xuefeng's mind, the intrigue of an heir to the Breinian throne enticed them. From what they understood from the information their spies provided, the throne was empty—select nobility and generals had formed a regency. Taking some of their finest warriors with them, Xuefeng decided to attend the invitation.

As Xuefeng and their small party arrived at the designated meeting spot, they were met by a Breinian general and a small platoon. After a brief exchange of formalities, the ground began to tremble. Xuefeng and their party went on high alert, the warriors immediately jumping into defensive positions while Xuefeng reared back and began to charge up an attack. 

Before they could finish, a young dragon burst forth from the earth in a proud display of power.

Taken aback by the arrival of a new, young dragon they've never seen before, Xuefeng relaxed. Their party remained at the ready, dubiously considering the foreign dragon.

The young dragon introduced himself as Prince [[Cratos]] of Breinia. There was no time for questions as Cratos jumped straight to the point of the meeting: Breinia was willing to call a truce between their two nations. 

Acknowledging the losses between both sides, Cratos assured Xuefeng that although his progenitor may have been a threat to Shuǐeh, Cratos had no intentions of continuing their campaign of conquest. 

The bigger problem was Hrærek. 

He was currently tearing a warpath through Breinia, aiming southward to eventually claim Shuǐeh as well. So far, Breinia had been able to considerably slow down his path to conquest with their strategic warfare and mighty military, but they wouldn't be able to hold Hrærek off alone forever. Eventually, Hrærek's forces would carve their bloody path to Shuǐeh's doorstep and lay complete devastation to the lands and people.

If Breinia and Shuǐeh could join forces, however, they could put an end to Hrærek's bloody warpath. With how central Hrærek's role as king was to [[Åskvädjr]], the kingdom would surely be forced to retreat and scale back in the ensuing fallout from his defeat. As Åskvädjr would be forced to figure out its own internal affairs or collapse as a nation, Breinia would be able to commit one last final push westward to reclaim the land that was rightfully theirs. In return for Shuǐeh's collaboration in the defeat of Hrærek, Cratos offered to return control of small parts of the southwestern and eastern lands that Breinia had previously taken from Shuǐeh.

The incentive for providing aid was less than ideal for Xuefeng—they wanted to see the whole of Shuǐeh restored, not just a part of it. However, Xuefeng recognized that with Hrærek's forces rapidly approaching, accepting Cratos' truce and proposition would be the only way to ensure the survival of Shuǐeh—even if it meant compromising their ambition to restore Shuǐeh to its former glory. Although they had not yet faced Hrærek in battle, they knew from their own spies that expecting anything other than decimation would be a delusion. 

If Breinia were to fall, Shuǐeh would most certainly be next.

Over the next four years, the war would ground to a stalemate with Breinia and Shuǐeh’s alliance forcing Åskvädjr onto defense. While Hrærek’s forces still managed to seize key victories occasionally, most battles end in hard-fought draws—and sometimes, Åskvädjr even suffered unexpected defeats.

The once unstoppable Åskvädjian march had slowed to a tense standstill, tension peaking but not quite breaking in close battles on the frontline. Meanwhile, behind closed doors, Cratos and Xuefeng convened regularly with their generals to meticulously plot their next moves—each meeting bringing them closer to the moment when they could finally strike Hrærek down. Their shared goal was clear: eliminate the proud conqueror and end the bloodshed once and for all.

The plan that they had ultimately settled on was a combination of a coordinated assault, guerilla tactics, and the element of surprise. [[Cratos]] and his army would face Hrærek head-on, surprising him by revealing himself as Aristides' progeny. This would serve to shock and taunt [[Hrærek]], drawing his attention onto Cratos and his army. 

Meanwhile, [[Xuefeng]] and their troops would engage in hit-and-run tactics, targeting Hrærek's flanks and supply lines to weaken his forces without becoming fully engaged in the main battle. Cratos would use his mastery of earth magic to protect his own troops and hinder Hrærek's movements, buying time for the Shuǐan guerilla attacks to take their toll. As the battle wore on, Hrærek's forces should become increasingly disorganized and demoralized, creating openings for the allied armies to exploit.

At the right opportunity, Xuefeng would launch a surprise attack on Hrærek, combining their water magic with Cratos' earth magic to overwhelm the lightning dragon, slaying him. From there, the remnants of Hrærek's troops would be demoralized to the point of being easy pickings for the allied forced to wipe out in a total victory.

They merely needed to wait for the right time to execute the plan. The opportunity would present itself in 84 NW with reports of Hrærek appearing to personally take the lead on the coastal campaign to cut through Breinia and reach Shuǐeh found their way to Cratos, Xuefeng, and their generals during a war meeting. Now would be the time to act. 

Cratos and his troops would face Hrærek on land while Xuefeng and their troops would make use of the [[Iphoa Gulf]] to utilize their superior navy. With it, they would ambush the Åskvädjian army before engaging in the hit-and-run tactics agreed upon. Coming to a quick agreement that this would be their chance to end this once and for all, both dragons quickly took to mobilizing their armies to intercept Hrærek.

---

In five days, the Breinian army stood ready on the flat plains, steep cliffs veering off into distant waters. From the shrouded mists, the Shuǐan navy was prepared to strike. According to intel received, the Åskvädjian army would be set to march here by the following day's noon. As the day of battle approached, Breinian supply lines were established while the Shuǐan navy set itself into position. Select parties went ahead to disembark onto land in order to prepare for an ambush on the enemy's backline and supply lines.
  

Everything now in place, both armies waited with bated breath for the sun to rise high. As the sun settled itself perfectly overhead, a proud Hrærek entered view over the horizon, imposing army marching behind him. 


As the Åskvädjian army approached, the Breinian troops held their formation until [[Hrærek]] came to a shocked stop a distance away. The dragon before him couldn't possibly be [[Aristides]]—no, he had killed his sibling all those years ago. He was sure of that. Was this their... progeny?


A proud proclamation of who [[Cratos]] was confirmed as much. The news was as shocking as it was annoying. No matter—if the little brat wished to lose his life by his lightning much like his progenitor did, then so be it.
  

Both dragons roared their battle cries as the clash began. Cratos surged forward with vengeful fury, aiming straight at Hrærek in a headlong assault. With a roar that shook both earth and sky, Hrærek charged towards Cratos, lightning crackling wildly around him as both dragons met in a violent collision, earth and lightning clashing in a display of raw power. Cratos' earthen barriers deflected Hrærek’s bolts, sparks flying as earth and lightning battled in a chaotic, furious struggle of primal forces.


Meanwhile, Xuefeng and their Shuǐan forces swept in from the flanks, launching swift, precise strikes against Hrærek's army from both land and sea. Water magic surged about, pressuring enemies towards the cliffs and knocking them off towards their watery graves before retreating. Xuefeng’s tactics unleashed chaos across the battlefield—confusing and disorienting Åskvädjian troops.
  

As the battle raged on for hours, Hrærek's forces grew increasingly disorganized, their morale waning under the relentless onslaught. Each calculated strike pushed Breinia and Shuǐeh closer to victory, plan unfolding with relentless resolve and strategic assaults.
  

After hours of fighting, Xuefeng finally spot it—an opportunity. Having kept enough distance to be out of the fight between earth and lightning, but close enough to keep an eye out for an opening to exploit, Xuefeng sees it in a series of pillar stone that forces Hrærek into an awkward and open dodge. Seizing the opportunity, Xuefeng unleashed a massive surge of water magic, hurtling it directly at Hrærek with deadly focus.
  

Hrærek, sensing the impending strike, managed to deflect the attack with a burst of lightning so powerful that it not only dangerously electrified the water, but cut right through it in a piercing bolt that struck Xuefeng with a devastating force. 

A weak wheeze left [[Xuefeng]] as they cursed Hrærek with their final breath before shattering into a flux of magical water energy.
  

Cratos, seeing his ally struck down, gained a renewed sense of vengeance. Hrærek's fall would be for Aristides, Breinia, and now Xuefeng. Channeling his earth magic with as much intensity as he could muster, he created a massive, swirling vortex of stone and soil that surrounded Hrærek. Despite being weakened by the vortex, Hrærek refused to fall. He drew upon his strength, unleashing a barrage of lightning bolts that danced around the swirling earth. The air itself crackled with the energy of the two clashing elements as Cratos and Hrærek engaged in a desperate struggle for dominance.


The ground quaked and the air trembled as the two dragons pushed their powers to the limit. Cratos' earth magic surged, the vortex tightening and constricting even as Hrærek's lightning grew more intense, illuminating the battlefield with its blinding flashes.


Slowly, Cratos began to gain the upper hand. His magic, fueled by the memory of all of the sacrifice and Aristides' legacy, proved too much for Hrærek to withstand. The lightning dragon's attacks grew weaker, his movements more sluggish as the vortex of rugged earth and piercing stone closed in around him.
  

With a final, defiant roar, Hrærek unleashed one last blinding burst of lightning—a desperate attempt to break free of the vortex. Drawing from his last reserves of power, Cratos' shielded his eyes and concentrated on holding his magic firm. Hrærek's lightning burst out brightly, collapsing the vortex in a blinding flash. 
  

Once Cratos was able to blink back his vision and see past the settling dust, the once-mighty conqueror was no where to be seen. In his place were particles of magical lightning energy dispersing aimlessly. Cratos stood victorious amidst the battlefield, but the triumph was bittersweet. 

It took the sacrifice of too many to stand where he was, but the bloody war was finally nearing its end. Xuefeng's memory would be honored for generations to come while the legacy of Aristides would live on through Cratos.

Now that the threat of Hrærek had been definitively dealt with, the attention of Cratos and both armies turned to the horrified Åskvädjian troops. The plains became soaked in the blood of Åskvädjians as Breinians and Shuǐans alike laid waste to the remnants of Hrærek's once-powerful army. 

By the end of it, only a single Åskvädjian soldier was left barely standing, completely surrounded. As Hrærek once commanded a defeated Breinian platoon, Cratos ordered the soldier to return to Åskvädjr and be prepared to either surrender or be annihilated.
