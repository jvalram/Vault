# Doctrine of the Eleven

**The Doctrine of the Eleven follows the Velesteus Doctrine up until the point of the creation of the new world.**

To create this new world, [[Velesteus]] broke [[Phiclai]] into three and graced this new world with new creations to accompany the humans that had already graced this land for so long.

However, this took all of [[Velesteus]]'s strength, shattering their soul into 6 pieces. The amount of sheer power required to create the new world was so intense that Asmotheus also found themselves shattering, their soul split into 5 pieces.

These pieces of shattered souls would fall onto the new Mulvao, each one transforming into a sentient embodiment of a new elemental type of magicâ€”a dragon. All 11 of these newly born dragons would land of the doorstep of [[Aurore]] and [[Princess Hozumi|Hozumi]].

---
[[Aurore]] and [[Princess Hozumi|Hozumi]] would take these dragons under their wings as caring mothers, nurturing them until adulthood.

These dragons would then go on to find the land that called to them, the strong tug of an elemental magic of their own type guiding their way.

Once in the land they would call home for the rest of their lives, the dragons would help establish nations that still hold strong to this day.
