A rare, clear/translucent stone capable of storing memories in perfect clarity. At the right angles, said memories can even visually show up on the side of it, a freeze frame in a shattered mirrorâ€”a kaleidoscope, even. 

The stone is incredibly difficult to destroy, but possible to crumble to dust (and take any memories stored within right with it) under the right conditions.

It comes with a cost: the memories are stored through transference. Whatever memories you chose to put into a piece of Memoriam, you yourself will forget until you reclaim the memory inside of the memorium.

The transference of memories can happen through one of two ways:
1. skin-to-stone contact. whatever memory is on you mind at the time of touching the memorium will be transferred over to the stone.
2. if the person doing skin-to-stone contact has an affinity for BOTH earth and mind magic, the person will be able to control the memory magic within the memorium more finely. the person can choose which memory to store at their leisure or prevent an accidental touch from taking their memory. the person can also do the same for another person touching the stone, able to pick and choose which memory to store for the other person.

To regain the memory stored in a memorium, all someone needs to do is touch a stone containing memories. This will transfer the memories from the stone to the person who touched it, vacating the memorium for new use. 

All [[Species|species]] are susceptible to memorium except for the following:
