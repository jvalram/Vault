In the beginning, there was nothing. And then, [[Velesteus]] opened their eyes and birthed [[Mulvao]] into existence, taking a piece of themselves and molding Mulvao in the palms of their hands.

With a world built, Velesteus closed their eyes and breathed onto the world in their hands, water cracking out from rock and flora taking root in the ground. Mulvao flourished in silence, and Velesteus was content.

As time passed, content turned into a gripping loneliness. Mulvao sat in [[Velesteus]]'s caring hands, but they had none to share it with. Velesteus wept over their revelation, their tears falling down onto Mulvao. 

From those tears, Velesteus own wish for someone to share Mulvao with was granted. As the tears hit the earth, the ground rose up and took shape into numerous types of creatures. 

Of these creatures, most were simple animals. Their greatest creation born from tears would be a creature they would bend down to gift them their name. "Human".

Velesteus would watch Mulvao with attentive eyes, smiling down onto the gift in her palms as she watched them interact with the world around them and each other. 

For their progress, Velesteus bent down and placed a kiss on the brow of a chosen few. Those worthy enough to be graced with Velesteus's touch found themselves granted with the ability to call upon the energy of light and bend it to their will.

While the people sung their praises and thanks to their maker, Velesteus closed their eyes with a smile on their lips. While Velesteus slept, someone plucked Mulvao out of Velesteus's hands. 

They looked down at the world that now sat in the palm of their hands. They found those worshiping Velesteus to be boring and the joy of the people to be boring. They were much more interested in the people who were bitter at not being blessed with the power of light. 

Those who had no interest in getting along, but chose to create strife and chaos where they could. This new god would spit onto their selected few, bestowing them with the ability to call upon the energy of darkness and bend it to their will, along with the name of their god—[[Asmotheus]].

As [[Velesteus]] began to stir awake from their slumber, Asmotheus carefully placed Mulvao back into their hands before taking their turn to sleep. 

When Velesteus woke to see people not only performing a magic they had no recollection of gifting with songs of another's name on their lips, Velesteus looked up from Mulvao, only to be met with an endless, empty space.

Time passed as Velesteus continued to watch the happenings of Mulvao from afar. Having already bestowed their gift onto the world they created, Velesteus was determined to allow humanity to make something of their own will. And so, Velesteus leaned back and watched.

For ages, Velesteus would watch from afar, but never interfere. Not until a wish so genuine, determined, and true reached them from where they were. A wish that begged with a sincerity and intensity that no other had done before—all for the sake of love. Velesteus would heed this wish, bending down to Mulvao one last time to reshape the world that they had created.

To create this new world, Velesteus broke [[Phiclai]] into three and graced this new world with new creations to accompany the humans that had already graced this land for so long. To watch this world better in their stead, Velesteus crafted their own children from pieces of themselves to place onto Mulvao, each one imbued with the core each new elemental magic they had created. 

With the new world created and their children sent to watch over it, Velesteus closed their eyes once more, unaware of the feeling of Mulvao being plucked out of their hands once more.

As [[Asmotheus]] cradled Mulvao with a critical eye, they decided to add their own touch to the world, creating but one species in their own imagine before passing Mulvao back to [[Velesteus]].
