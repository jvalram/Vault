A familiar is a soulbound animal companion that has three forms: animal form, hybrid form, and human form. The default form of a familiar is their hybrid form
### Familiar Politics
-----

In **[[Nations/Mulvao/Aukamen/Raj/Raj|Raj]]**, familiars are viewed as tools, especially by the upper class. The lower class too prolly, but to a lesser extent because they probably work right alongside their witches, whereas upper class witches just have their familiars do the work for them. 

-----

Familiars aren't popular amongst **[[Erzeung]]** and creation witches. Creation witches tend to prefer their own creations (automatons) over familiars. They see familiars as tools but what's the point of putting up with some familiar for life when you could just construct/deconstruct whatever help you needed at will? 

Creation witches are more likely to take up a familiar only to drain them of their magic. 

-----

In **[[Pensier]]**, the mind witches favor strong/brute strength animals for familiars to act as bodyguards/physical fighting force since most mind witches tend to be built like a twig and end up zoning out to focus everything into their magic. 

-----

**[[Terra]]** and its witches respect familiars. Earth witches tend to be more involved in combat so they see familiars as fellow partner in arms. 

-----

In **[[Shuǐeh]]**, they're seen as useful companions, especially when it comes to investigating and exploring deeper waters due to their expendability compared to a witch. 

-----

In **[[Klorída]]**, they're viewed similarly to how the A'lunian witches feel about them. The bond is something sacred. 

-----

In **[[Hava]]**, they view familiars simply as companions. The witches of Hava aren't as reliant on the boons of familiars. 

-----

In **[[Åskvädjr]]**, they're viewed as survival tools as Askvadjr has one of the most difficult terrains/weather to survive. 

-----

Witches of **[[Kjølik]]** like familiars as hunting companions—especially since the land is typically pretty barren aside from fish. 

-----

**[[Umlilo]]** see familiars as like, accessories. Like trophy husbands/wives. The prettier/stronger, the better. They see the familiar as a reflection of the witch. 

-----

In **[[A'lune]]**, witches all around take the bond between familiar and witch way more intimately. they see it as like, a soulmate (platonically), so they treat familiars w a lot of respect over there
