In the year 500 NW, a man made his way to the [[Pool of Velesteus]] as the moon eclipsed the sun and wished. 

His wish was one to bring chaos to the world.

As soon as the wish left his lips, the world erupted into just that. All at once, natural disasters mercilessly rose up to destroy. A thick, dark fog instantaneously settled across [[Mulvao]], blocking out both the sun and the moon from vision. 

All across [[Braudrica]] and [[Aukamen]], severe droughts hit as earthquakes split the lands while tsunamis and hurricanes saw them sunk. [[Kjølik]] faced endless avalanches and blizzards along with tremors that would see Kjølik reduce to half of its original size.

The wish not only brought these disasters that would go on to claim millions of lives but something even more sinister, more personal—demons. [[Demon]], an evil that had never plagued the world before were wished into existence. 

Spontaneously created in any space that any living being inhabited, demons pillaged and killed amongst other horrid crimes.

In response to the sudden outburst of chaos, all of Mulvao witnessed as their dragons—some thought to be long dead and others known to be inactive—rose up to defend the people of their nations. 

Another miracle was brought upon the people of Mulvao alongside the rise of their dragons—a new type of winged being birthed into existence that seemed to focus on slaying demons and saving people—[[Justicars]]

Despite the aid, Mulvao would see itself struggle to survive against the constant onslaught of natural disasters, lack of natural light, and demons.

5 years into the event people had begun to call World's Calamity, life on Mulvao was barely hanging on. Just as it was seeming that all of Mulvao would lose itself to chaos, a moment of eureka struck all of the dragons. 

Without a word, they all abandoned their posts and flew straight to the [[Pool of Velesteus]] in [[A'lune]].

Once all 11 dragons had gathered at the pool, each dragon unleashed all the energy they could into the pool. Light sprung from the pool, growing brighter and brighter until a flash of blinding light covered all of Mulvao in an instant. After the light finally settled and people could see once more, the Mulvao that greeted them was cleansed.

The dragons were nowhere to be found. People who were present moments ago had vanished. Some illnesses thought to have been cured were brought back in full force. Wealth once obtained was nowhere to be found. But these were not the focus of the people. 

When the people of Mulvao had opened their eyes, clear blue skies and a shining sun greeted them. Piles of ash and pools of viscous liquid laid where demons had been standing moments ago. The rumbles of earthquakes and the howls of tornadoes had quieted down into a peaceful silence.

Balance had been restored, but at a cost. As the people of Mulvao rebuilt and counted their losses, a stunning conclusion was made. 

The dragons had wiped the world clean of anything that was the direct result of a wish. Those who had vanished after the light were found to be people existing because their lives had been wished for by their parents. 

The illnesses that came back were previously cured through wishes. Families wealthy for generations found their infinite wealth wished by their ancestors gone without a trace.

But the people of Mulvao were strong. They took their losses and rebuilt, looking forward to a brighter future.
