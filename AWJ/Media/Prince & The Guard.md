A trilogy of books that follows the love story of Prince Yoshinaga Hayato of [[Kiagora]] and his loyal Guard, Natanaël Bassot of [[Rauceveth]]. 

The first book in the series, **Prince & The Guard: The Contract**, follows the first 10 years of Prince Yoshinaga and Guard Natanaël's relationship, as Natanaël had been contracted to serve the Prince for a decade's time. 

The two fall in love, but their relationship comes to an end when Natanaël's father comes to collect him, and Natanaël chooses to leave Prince Yoshinaga behind so that Natanaël's village of well trained guards do not exact revenge on him. 

The second book in the series, **Prince & The Guard: The Promise**, sees the reunion of Prince Yoshinaga and Guard Natanaël nine years later at a political meeting regarding the borders of [[Kiagora]] and its neighboring nation, [[Phiclai]]. 

Several complications prevent Natanaël from being with Prince Yoshinaga, but Prince Yoshinaga promises his lover that they will be together again along with their surprise daughter, Karine. 

The third book in the series, **Prince & The Guard: The Return**, sees Prince Yoshinaga fulfilling his promise to Natanaël and their daughter, Karine. Successfully bringing them back home to [[Kiagora]], the family peacefully live out the rest of their lives as Prince Yoshinaga becomes crowned King and rules the kingdom of Kiagora with a righteous hand.

**General Consensus:** The book series is regarded as popular among teenagers and young adults as a romance title, especially in [[Pensier]], [[Umlilo]], [[Nations/Mulvao/Aukamen/Raj/Raj|Raj]], and [[A'lune]]. Among its target demographic, it's described as very well written, but heavily cliched. 

The general consensus of book ranking is as follows: Prince & The Guard: The Promise, Prince & The Guard: The Contract, Prince & The Guard: The Return.
