Type: [[HG]] #show
Premiered 1490-present NW

An [[HG]] show based on the premise of "hot and sexy" singles coming together to live on a beautiful island for a maximum of 10 weeks in order to find love. Each week, the contestants are to pair up with someone and become a couple. 

At the end of the week, the entire group votes off one couple. The show continues with this basic pattern aside from unique and quirky challenges, games, and surprises being thrown into the mix. 

The winning couple is the one that wins the final vote—one uniquely conducted by the viewer base. The winning couple wins an all-expenses-paid weeklong trip to a rotating selection of touristy locations. There are currently 10 seasons.

**General Consensus:** The show is regarded as "typical trash reality [[HG]]" by most everyone. Despite this, it is an extremely popular dating show amongst teenagers and young adults. It is most popular in [[Shuǐeh]], [[Umlilo]], and [[Pensier]].
