Published: (adapted from a folk tale traced back to around 100 NW)

A children's book depicting the story of souls. It is unique in that there are no words to it, only pictures. 

Each nation seems to have its own slight version of this tale colored through the native culture's lens, but the general story remains consistent. 

In it, pictures show people in the [[Phiclai]]. These people are shown to be created by [[Velesteus]] themselvesâ€”the first humans and witches. 

Depending on the nation the copy was created in, the book follows the life of a different witch in the [[Phiclai|Old World]]. In their moment of death, Velesteus is shown to scoop their soul out and place it into a new one born of the flesh. 

This cycle continues as the world seems to evolve and modernize around the protagonist. Eventually the protagonist seems to be drawn to the [[Pool of Velesteus]] and prays. 

In their next life, the protagonist is seen waking up with tears in their eyes and their lips open, a hand clenched over their heart.

**General Consensus:** Almost every child has been told this story in one form or another. It is generally interpreted as suggesting the idea that everyone is reincarnated. <- Erzeunites think reincarnation is stupid wish wash

However, with little to no information about the creator of this tale plus few and far tales of supposedly reincarnated people who claim to remember their past lives, the idea of this children's tale being based on fact is regarded as extremely far fetched. 

Interestingly enough, very little copies of this book exist within [[Erzeung]]. Those that are found are typically of a very old print.
