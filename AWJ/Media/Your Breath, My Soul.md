A folk tale revolving around the love story between a [[Mermaid]] prince and a siren hunter. 

It tells of a [[Species/Siren]] hunter, Saito, being a hailed champion from the small town of [[Chuncheok]]. A master of lightning magic, she was a beloved hero who kept the people safe from the threat of sirens. 

Unbeknownst to the people, she made close friends with a mermaid prince—Peleg. The two would meet up in shallow waters, conversing for hours about everything. Eventually, the two grew to have an extremely close bond. One stormy night while she was out in the sea hunting, her ship and crew fell to a horde of sirens. 

As the ship capsized and was torn to shreds, Prince Peleg rescued the drowning witch from the bloodthirsty sirens who shrieked for vengeance. As he tried to bring her back up to the surface to breathe, he noticed Saito's lack of movement. 

She would not make it. In an act of desperation, he gave her a kiss with which he shared his breath and magic with her. The kiss worked in saving her, transforming Saito into a mermaid. However, in doing so, Peleg turned into a witch. 

As Saito took breath and opened her eyes, Peleg began to drown and closed his own eyes. Foreign to their new bodies, Saito helplessly watched on as her savior drowned.

**General Consensus:** This [[Shuǐeh]]i folk tale is a popular work of classical literature featured in many nations' curriculum. Over millennium, both scholars and students alike have debated what the true moral of this tale is. 

The most popular interpretation is that this is a tragic tale of the sacrifices we make for love. Another notable interpretation is that this is a cautionary tale of the inherit differences between species.
