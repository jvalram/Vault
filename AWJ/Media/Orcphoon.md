A movie that dares to ask the question: What if orcas got swept up by typhoons and then started to attack people as they were spat out onto land? 

The movie also dares to answer it, following the protagonist, Heechul Paek, as he predicts a typhoon strong enough to suck up and empower orcas—an Orcphoon. 

None of his colleagues believe him, so it's up to him and his sister's girlfriend, Guanting Qiu, to break the Orcphoon machine in the evil scientist's Ju Zi's base to stop the Orcphoon. 

Although they don't get there fast enough to prevent it, an orca landing onto Guanting and eating her, Heechul is able to defeat Ju and break the machine with his water magic, saving all of Shuǐeh from the Orcphoon.

**General Consensus:** The movie is regarded as absolutely terrible by teenagers, adults, and the elderly, but is an enormous hit with children despite being a rated R movie. At its peak, it was popular in [[Shuǐeh]] and [[Erzeung]].
