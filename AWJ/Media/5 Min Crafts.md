Author: [[Anita Bathe]]
Aired: (created 1355 NW and ongoing since)

A collection of projects you can do with around the house items and little time.

**General Consensus:** The series has what can be called a "cult following" amongst children and their grandparents across the world for the quick and fun projects the series provides. 

Children in particular take great fun in repeating the author's name quickly as it sounds very similar to the phrase "I need a bath" in Common. Although popular just about everywhere, it is particularly popular in [[Erzeung]], [[Pensier]], and [[Terra]].

Originated in [[Pensier]]
