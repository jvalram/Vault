An Erzeun children's book adapted from an old [[Åskvädjr]]ian folk tale, "Mishka and Mooshka" depicts the whacky misadventures of two twin court jesters—Mishka and Mooshka. 

The story begins with the court jesters Mishka and Mooshka failing to make the king laugh. For their failure, the king exiles them to relearn the art of humor from the world around them and to not return until they can make the king laugh again. 

On their journey, Mishka and Mooshka meet all kinds of people and learn new jokes and tricks. After they've travelled the world and learned from the people they met on their journey, they return to the king with a new show and succeed in making the king laugh.

**General Consensus:** A highly popular children's book often regarded as a "Classic", Mishka and Mooshka is praised for not only introducing all of the world's nations and native species, but for encouraging friendliness, a can-do attitude, and an appreciation for lighthearted humor. 

Although originally published in [[Erzeung]], the story is widely considered an Åskvädjrian one given its source of inspiration. This is especially the case given Åskvädjr's general lack of any printed media that would preserve the nation's tales and cultures outside of oral means.
