# The Kalawakan Islands
The Kalawakan Islands were once part of [[Mulvao]], but were cut out and pasted into a pocket dimension by celestial dragon [[REDACTED]].

Witches exiled from the Kalawakan Islands are stripped of their magic and magically forced to keep silent about the existence of the islands or celestial magic

the ppl in charge there reverently and feverishly worship the celestial dragon, [[REDACTED]] â€“ the only currently living original dragon.
