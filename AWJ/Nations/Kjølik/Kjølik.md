**Kjølik** is both a nation and a continent on the north of [[Mulvao]]. Ice magic naturally courses through the land here. 

Besides being known for its infamously cold weather, Kjølik is the only other nation to have locals claim a dragon resides on the land—this dragon being rumored to be extremely violent and a threat to the small communities of Kjølik from where it resides at the peak of the Glacies Mountain.

The people of Kjølik are referred to as Kjølish

Kjølik is considered a #2nd-world nation
#### Topography

The nation of Kjølik is a land of sparse tundra that disappear into nothing but ice and snow the further north you travel from its coastlines. 

The land is also host to a surprising amount of lakes. Although most of these lakes are frozen for most of the year, during the Anunoth Moon the lakes are covered by a thin veil of ice. This ice is extremely simple to break through, making it either extremely dangerous to travel across or an excellent swimming spot depending on who you ask. 

At the pole is a great mountain range—the Glaices Mountains.
#### Trade and Industry

In terms of industries, Kjølik is best known for its booming lumber, ice, mineral, fish, and special tree oil industries.

Kjølik is major trade partners with [[A'lune]], [[Terra]], [[Erzeung]], and [[Pensier]].
#### Adventuring Culture

The adventuring culture is a prevalent one in Kjølik. Despite the near two millennia Kjølik has existed, its snowy lands have still yet to be entirely explored and mapped. 

With no particularly big industry aside from ice and lumber, adventuring is a respectable and encouraged occupation for young people.
#### Naming Conventions

As far as first names go in Kjølik, they typically are reminiscent of names that can be found in the Nordic region.

As for last names, Kjølik last names are usually the first name of one parent, usually the one with a more notable lineage, with either a "dottir", "son", or "kin" attached to end, usually in correspondence with the person's gender.

Examples include:

Saella **Brunidottir**
Frey **Saellason**
Osk **Hakikin**
#### Funeral Rites

The bodies of the deceased are typically frozen solid through a number of means. 

A select few choose to use nevermelt ice for this process, but most opt for living ice. Once the body has been sufficiently frozen, an intimate ceremony is held to celebrate the deceased's life. This usually involves the sharing of stories and achievements of the deceased while taking a trek through the deceased's favorite area. 

At the end of the trek, the frozen deceased is brought out and everyone takes turns saying their final goodbyes to the deceased. Once the goodbyes are done, the body is then shattered by the attendees. 

Upon shattering, the ice and all within it immediately transforms into magical ice energy and scatters into the wind. 

For those that opt for nevermelt ice instead of living ice, this final step is skipped and the deceased is moved somewhere to be presented—usually a family member's home or a favorite location of the deceased.
#### [[World's Calamity]]

Kjølik faced endless avalanches and blizzards along with tremors that would see it reduce to half of its original size.
