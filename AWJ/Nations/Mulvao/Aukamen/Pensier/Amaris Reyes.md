## BIO
Current Headmaster of [[Conlegium di Magia Raffiata]], Primus of [[Pensier]]

She is a full mind witch with barn owl and mantis shrimp familiars.  

She's based in the capital of [[Pensier]], [[Basilia]]. Although her duties primarily lie in being one half of the nation's Primuses, she often travels to [[Radonia]], the city that hosts the great Conlegium di Magia Raffiata—the school Amaris is the headmaster of. 

Along these two very intensive jobs, she's also the official head of the High Witches. Between all three of these jobs, Amaris seems to never catch a break (and it shows in her ruffled appearance). (edited)
### REL LORE DUMP

- Out of all of the High Witches, she, [[Cecelia von Wintemp|Cecelia]], "Luna", and [[Bjarke]] are arguably the strongest 
- If politics didn't matter, she would definitely try tripping Cecelia 
- She and Cecelia used to date when they both were students at the [[Conlegium di Magia Raffiata|CMR]]. Amaris was the one to dump Cecelia. 
- gay gay homosexual gay 
- Addicted to coffee 
- Her specialization in mind magic lies within spells focused on illusions 
- Amaris doesn't really feel a connection to those sharing her magic type, but she loves to teach and watch those under her tutelage grow (hence her career as a headmaster alongside her duties as Primus)

FROM REL DMS

Amaris and Saella meet the first day of school through a shared class. Amaris initially thinks nothing of Saella—why should she? She's a nobody and Amaris is (partially) here to build connections that will benefit her in the future. Saella is a bit curious about Amaris' popularity—it's hard to ignore how the other students flock to her with eager introductions.

Yet by the end of the first week, first impressions regarding performance and presentation are complete. the immediate standouts in the class? Amaris and Saella. this has Amaris' curiosity piqued while Saella is just happy to be doing so well at school.

Amaris approaches Saella after the class (ignoring the flock of eager students vying for her attention) and makes proper introductions. she's a bit charmed (platonic) by Saella's cute and kind demeanor. it's a breath of fresh air how refreshing honest Saella is. she's kind and sweet, but there's no intent behind it. that's just how she is! Saella is surprised to be approached by Amaris of all people (she's learned of who Amaris is and why people flock to her—she'd probably have been hard pressed to still be unaware by the end of the week), but she treats Amaris just like anyone else—with a kind smile and a positive attitude.

the two get along swimmingly. Amaris feels as though Saella is the only friend she has that she can truly be candid with and therefore, a close confidante. Saella is simply happy to have made such a smart and thoughtful friend! Truth be told, she had trouble making friends. despite her friendliness, her upbringing and background had othered her from the rest of the [[Aukamen]] students and even some [[Braudrica|Braudican]] students. Amaris didn't care about any of that and saw Saella for who she was.  

As their time in the academy progressed, they both found love interests. Saella in [[# Ramona da Regalado]]: the twin sister of [[Madalena da Regalado]]; group member of Amaris. Amaris in [[Cecelia von Wintemp]]: an outcast and social pariah she had took pity on per Saella's influence (trying to be a kinder and more open person) and her suggestion ("She looks so lonely over there, Amaris...").

Their own respective romances aside, their friendship continued to blossom and deepen. by the end of the freshman year, they were best friends.

In the fallout of the attack on [[Conlegium di Magia Raffiata|CMR]], Amaris was Saella's primary pillar of support. she prioritized stabilizing Saella's wellbeing by making sure she was taking care of herself and speaking with her to help her process the horrible events she bore witness to.

When school functions were resumed, the two were closer than ever. despite not being in the same group/party, much less the same track, the two could almost always be found with the other. 

Come graduation, the two shared a heartfelt farewell. Amaris told Saella she would always have a place here in [[Pensier]]—she need only let her know. Saella gave Amaris her profuse thanks for supporting her throughout all of the years and for being a source of comfort. the two promised to keep in touch through letters and exchanged addresses. they marked the farewell with an emotional hug before leaving—Saella to the docks and Amaris to her home.
