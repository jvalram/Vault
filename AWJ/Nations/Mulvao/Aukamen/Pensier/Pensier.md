**Pensier** is a nation on the west side of [[Aukamen]]. Mind magic naturally courses through the land here.

Pensier is renown for its famous schools and centers of learning—particularly the Conlegium di Magia Raffiata ([[Higher Education]]), an extremely exclusive academy that aims to produce the best witches in all of Mulvao.

The people of Pensier are referred to as Penish

Pensier is considered a #1st-world nation
#### Topography

Generally, the nation of Pensier is known for its flat lands. 

In the modern day, its hard to tell what the land was naturally like as this nation is heavily populated and it shows with the lack of "nature." 

What natural lands that have yet to be torn down are taiga on the northern half and savannas on the southern half. 

A small part of the Neblig Mountain Range runs through the border with [[Erzeung]].

#### Education

Pensier has a national education system that runs from k-12, just like the other nations of Aukamen. 

The full length of this system is reinforced everywhere, even smaller towns having at least two different venues of education to select from. Being the nation that often first comes to mind in the pursuit of knowledge, Pensier is the nation home to the highest amount of academic institutions. 

If there is an academic community regarding a topic, odds are there are at least a handful of academic institutions dedicated to the study of it existing within Pensier. Nearly all well paying jobs require at least one degree, but it is not uncommon for particularly well paying jobs to require upwards of 3 degrees. 

Pensier is home to one of "The Big Three" in terms of higher education options for magic users. 

Pensier's [[Conlegium di Magia Raffiata]] is one of "The Big Three". It is often regarded as the single best option for magic users wanting to seriously improve their magic. Located in the lakeside city of [[Radonia]], this school is known for its hybrid of Georgian and Classical architecture, enormously sized campus grounds, and its impressive alumni—being the home school of a great amount of High Witches throughout history.

#### Adventuring Culture

Despite hosting the largest amount of notable schools of magic, the adventuring culture within Pensier itself is minimal. 

A big part of the reason for this has to do with what many adventures would call a "lack of reason to adventure." Not much of Pensier's natural lands remain to be explored. 

The only notable exploration to be made are within the forests that [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Gumiho|Gumiho]] are known to make homes in, but adventuring into those areas are highly discouraged for safety reasons. Those looking for adventure are pointed in the direction of either [[Braudrica]] as a whole or the neighboring nation of [[Nations/Mulvao/Aukamen/Raj/Raj|Raj]]. 

However, to those skilled enough, the Pensier government does have a dedicated branch to dealing with magical threats.
#### Politics

In Pensier, there are two people at the top. They are referred to as "Primus". One human and one witch. Below them is the **High Council**. 

The High Council is made up of 25 humans and 25 witches. 

To get into the council, you need to be elected by the people (if you're a human). If you're a witch, you also need to be elected, but it would seem as though top graduates from the [[Conlegium di Magia Raffiata]] seem to get in with little trouble. 

This High Council debate on laws and political issues. If a certain proposition gets at least 15 human votes and 15 witch votes, it gets passed onto the Primuses, who then must both unanimously agree to pass it. 

This council also deals with criminal issues as well, of which the Primuses must also unanimously agree on the criminal issues as well. This only applies to what the equivalent of serious felonies would be. 

There's a bunch of low councils that deal with lesser crimes and more local laws/regulations. Those are made up of 10 humans and 10 witches. Flat out majority vote gets things decided.
#### Naming Conventions

Names in Pensier are typically reminiscent of Italian and Ancient Rome names.
#### Funeral Rites

Funeral rites in Pensier are not as grand of an affair. 

To celebrate the life of the deceased, a memorium (or collection of memorium) is presented at the funeral. The memories within are projected onto a blank canvas, allowing all attendees to view memories of the deceased through their own lives. 

For those who can afford it, it is also not uncommon to get a biography of the deceased privately commissioned. These biographies are often limited copies and are not publicly published as they are meant for personal family tree/history record keeping. 

The bodies of the deceased are often either cremated or buried in graveyards.
