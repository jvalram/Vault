The people of Umlilo are referred to as Umlilan 

Umlilo is considered a #1st-world nation
#### Topography

On nearly all coastlines of Umlilo are beaches. A bit further inland, the beaches become savannas before transforming into vast swaths of deserts. 

In Umlilo, there are two major deserts, both separated by a range of mesas and canyons that split the deserts vertically. The islands to the southwest are tropical paradises with thick jungles and waterfalls. 

The coast area of the mainland in that area in particular also has more natural vegetation than the rest of the nation. 

Several volcanoes are scattered amongst the mainland, both active and inactive
#### Adventuring Culture

The adventuring culture within Umlilo is moderate. As Umlilo focuses on becoming a nation known for lush and lavish indulgences or trying to scrape by depending on who you ask, adventuring tends to not be on the mind of the average citizen.

To those who have the luxury or dream to go adventuring, abandoned temples from a bygone era lie overrun by jungles in the islands of Umlilo that call to those who wish for an exciting endeavor.
#### Politics

Umlilo is run by matriarchal monarchy. 

Said monarchy is a long line of powerful witches. It is not uncommon for the queen to also be the top witch of the nation. 

There are many regional governments, all of which the heads are chosen by the Queen herself. The people beneath the head are chosen by the head.
#### Naming Conventions

There are generally three types of names within Umlilo. 

The first subset are names reminiscent of Akan names. 

The second subset are names reminiscent of Portuguese names. 

The third subset are names reminiscent of Hindi names.
#### Funeral Rites

Funeral pyres are the norm of this nation across the board. 

The ceremony and its lavishness is highly dependent on the socioeconomic standing of the deceased. At minimum, the ceremony will involve the burning of the deceased dressed in their finest clothes and jewelry. 

The deceased's prized possessions are burned alongside the deceased, often placed around the deceased on the pyre before it is lit. 

For grander ceremonies, celebrations including traditional dances, fire magician shows, preferred activities of the deceased, and feasts are common.

It is considered auspicious when a phoenix flies over the funeral pyre.
