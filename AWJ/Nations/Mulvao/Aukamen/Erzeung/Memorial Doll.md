It is customary for people of [[Erzeung]] to get commissioned mechanical dolls of the deceased to remember them by. 

The dolls are known as "Memorial Dolls." These dolls are not overly elaborate or big, usually ending up the size of a regular teddy bear plush. The dolls come in a variety of artistic styles, but all remained united in that they are recognizably a doll of the deceased. 

Inside each doll is a small urn to hold the cremated ashes of the deceased in. Depending on what the buyer of the Memorial Doll can afford, the doll's features range from being a simple doll to being able to walk and talk with audio recordings of the deceased.
