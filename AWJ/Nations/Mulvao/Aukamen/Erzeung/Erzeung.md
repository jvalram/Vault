**Erzeung** is a nation on the east side of [[Aukamen]]. Creation magic naturally courses through the land here. 

Erzeung is known to be an industrial powerhouse internationally that is technologically leagues ahead of all of the other nations—particularly those outside of the continent of Aukamen.

**Altenbrück** is the capital of Erzeung. All other cities listed are large cities. Smaller cities and towns are not included in this map. 

The people of Erzeung are referred to as Erzeunites. 

Erzeung is considered a #1st-world nation
#### Topography

Along the southern gulf coast, beaches quickly turn into savannas. Those savannas in turn transform into taigas the further inland you go. Within these taigas, there are spatterings of dense forests. 

However, the forests of Erzeung are notably different from forests anywhere else. The variety of trees are lacking. Most trees are eerily tall and are either pale white or near charcoal black in color. 

A deep fog covers the forests at all times—a fog that is nearly impossible to clear out. In the clearings found in Erzeun forests, there is nothing. No flora, no fauna, no grass. Simply flat ground. 

The vibe of the forests are different too. An undeniable sense of unease and danger always lurks in the air of Erzeun forests. The islands in the north of Erzeung are known to primarily consists of more taigas. 

Throughout a good portion of Erzeung also lies the [[Neblig Mountain Range]]
#### Adventuring Culture

Adventuring culture within Erzeung is almost nonexistent. 

Being the nation known best for its constant technological progression and global leader in modernization, the adventuring spirit has no place within the bustling cities that only look to the future. 

Those wishing to become adventurers either emigrate out of Erzeung or attempt to seek adventure within the dark forests of Erzeung, never to be heard from again
#### Politics

Erzeung is an authoritarian dictatorship ruled by the **Supreme General** - [[Cecelia von Wintemp]], [[High Witch]] of Creation (a title bestowed onto the most powerful witch of that magic type). 

Her family, the von Wintemps, have been in power since around the time that the historical event "[[World's Calamity]]" ended (507 NW or 505 NW — current day is 1500 NW))

Erzeunites also tend to have superiority complexes towards non-erzeunites, ESPECIALLY towards people from [[Braudrica]]. 
##### Government Structure

**Supreme General (SG)**: the authoritative ultimate authority. has the ability to enact and veto anything uncontested

**Inner Circle**: the Supreme General's advisory council. They are the ones who gather up the facts and scenarios to the SG and provide their council/advice/opinions to the SG. A lot tend to have their own agendas (often being in-line with the SG's own)

**Major Generals**: the high official that's responsible for their relevant dept. They are officially unnamed. 

**SG** approves/vetoes anything the Inner Circle brings to their attention. Its up to the **Inner Circle** to stay on top of everything lest something goes wrong and the **SG** decides lopping your head off is an appropriate punishment for making them look bad
##### Public Perception

The people of Erzeung with an opinion that matters love her! (they have to)
##### Class System
Erzeung is plagued with classism and there are very harsh divides between each class. 
###### Low: 
Miserable. You won't find these ppl in any major cities, instead you'll find them in slum cities on the outside of said cities or in villages/towns in more rural areas. 

Not very technologically developed environment they live in because those with creative minds and talented magical abilities get scouted by the government and whisked off to become "proper contributing members of societies" who are then placed into those well developed cities to continue contributing to progress. 

Very grim and hopeless vibes, many scramble for the chance to prove themselves worthy of being selected to literally move up in life.

In the slums, authority figures aren't very present unless its in slums that border cities or Erzeung's border, so there's not as much propaganda to garner their support for their nation. 

Border presence is to keep them in, major city presence is to keep them out. 
###### Middle: 
Those who live in Erzeung's middle class are very content! 

You'll find them living in up-and-coming cities or major cities. They get access to the tech advancements Erzeung is well known for. 

The only real limit is how much can the middle-class wealth in your pockets handle. Like America, there is a significant gap between what middle and high class can afford, but middle class is livable without struggle. 

No Erzeun middle class person is working paycheck-to-paycheck, but the average single doesn't have "owns a car" money (cars in Erzeung are still considered a luxury item)

###### High:

Those who live in Erzeung's High class live extremely well.

##### Rebellions

Rebel groups have existed in the past, but the Supreme General historically orders for complete extinction with extreme prejudice. Those who rebel will die. 

When rebel groups have existed, they start in the lower class. Though in the past they've been able to garner sympathy from the middle/high class, the eradication approach from the SG has dried all of it up. Class status will not save you if you are a sympathizer of the enemies of the Supreme General.

The middle/high class have never rebelled because they've never had anything to rebel over. 
##### Slum/Village Extractions

- Local government does a census headcount annually, and that information gets passed on to the capital. Basic population statistical tracking is how the government knows which doors to knock on to gather up which people. Usually these things are conducted in an open outdoor space.
- They have devices they strap up to you to basically measure things like exertion (similar to a heart rate monitor), magical reserve levels, general health, etc. 
	- Erzeung has developed technology capable of quantifying what we know as the magical reserve stat. Usually magical reserves is more a _feeling_,
- While hooked up, they ask you to perform your best magic for them (whether you're doing your best or not is determined by the exertion monitor). 
- After that, they'll ask you to perform a couple spells to see if you're actually capable of doing those—and if you can, how well.
- A person is deemed worthy of extraction if they pass the benchmarks/standards created by the government. Examiners are basically given a checklist. If selected, you're allowed to go pack up with an escort, then you hop in the government vehicle and get carted off to the city
#### Education

Erzeung has a national education system that runs from k-12, just like the other nations of Aukamen. The full length of this system is reinforced everywhere in cities and towns.

The nation boasts an incredible amount of technological resources that aid in studies such as top-of-the-line devices, holo-computers, and personal robotic tutors. It also prides itself in promoting creation and invention within the standard curriculum, sharpening the minds and promoting creativity throughout the upcoming generations. 

Within the curriculum, Erzeung's own standing as a nation is greatly elevated as the premier and leading nation of Mulvao, attributed to being the most technologically advanced nation and also being the richest nation.

Value in an educational degree is significant. Many high-paying jobs and roles within cities will require a degree—of which all cities in Erzeung have at least one university, college, or other form of higher education available to attend.

Erzeung is home to one of "[[The Big Three]]" in terms of higher education options for magic users. Erzeung's "[[Altenbrück University]]" is one of "The Big Three". The curriculum is balanced between magic and academia and open for all species to attend. 

With a very rigorous application process with applicants needing to receive a final stamp of approval from the Supreme General herself, only the best of the best attend [[Altenbrück University]]. Located within the heart of the nation, Altenbrück, this school is known for its Gothic architecture and its impressive alumni—many going on to become high ranking officials within Erzeung or leaders of their industry internationally.
#### Naming Conventions

Two types of names are typically associated with Erzeung. 

The first type are names reminiscent of **German** names. 

The second type are names reminiscent of **Russian** names.
#### Funeral Rites
It is customary for people to get commissioned mechanical dolls of the deceased to remember them by. The dolls are known as "[[Memorial Doll|Memorial Dolls]]." 

These dolls are not overly elaborate or big, usually ending up the size of a regular teddy bear plush. The dolls come in a variety of artistic styles, but all remained united in that they are recognizably a doll of the deceased. 

Inside each doll is a small urn to hold the cremated ashes of the deceased in. Depending on what the buyer of the [[Memorial Doll]] can afford, the doll's features range from being a simple doll to being able to walk and talk with audio recordings of the deceased.
#### Immigration and Emigration

People from Erzeung aren't usually very inclined to leave.

A dictator makes it hard (yet not impossible) to legally emigrate, but even without [[Cecelia von Wintemp|Cecelia]], Erzeung is the most advanced nation in the world with PLENTY of job opportunities and the like.

In order to legally emigrate, you need to obtain special permission from the government. Its mostly a matter of Erzeung keeping a grip on their creation magic driven economy.

A human is way more likely to be allowed to legally emigrate.

For higher level witches, you often have to present the government with a long series of documents known as a "[[Life Plan]]". In the Life Plan, you write out what your plan is after leaving Erzeung in excruciating detail for the next 10-20 years depending on what length of writing the government mandates. These documents are then submitted and processed, at which point the government will notify you whether your request to emigrate has been accepted or not.

If accepted, the government will send out people to occasionally check on you and make sure your following your Life Plan. If you've deviated from it, you are required to write back to the Erzeung government exactly what's going on and submit a new Life Plan. Failure to comply results in you being dragged back to Erzeung and dealing with the consequences there.

All nations except Pensier are in an active agreement with Erzeung that allows them do this. No new families are forcefully taken back to Erzeung—only the offender themselves.
#### MISC

Erzeunites don't care for many of the dragons and only believe/care about the original dragon, [[Grima]]. They have surpassed the need for a dragon in their society.
