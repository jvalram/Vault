In order to legally emigrate from [[Erzeung]], you need to obtain special permission from the government. Its mostly a matter of Erzeung keeping a grip on their creation magic driven economy.

A human is way more likely to be allowed to legally emigrate.

For higher level witches, you often have to present the government with a long series of documents known as a "Life Plan". 

In the Life Plan, you write out what your plan is after leaving Erzeung in excruciating detail for the next 10-20 years depending on what length of writing the government mandates. These documents are then submitted and processed, at which point the government will notify you whether your request to emigrate has been accepted or not.

If accepted, the government will send out people to occasionally check on you and make sure your following your Life Plan. If you've deviated from it, you are required to write back to the Erzeung government exactly what's going on and submit a new Life Plan. Failure to comply results in you being dragged back to Erzeung and dealing with the consequences there.

All nations except Pensier are in an active agreement with Erzeung that allows them do this. No new families are forcefully taken back to Erzeungâ€”only the offender themselves.
