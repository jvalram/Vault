##### RELATIONSHIPS:

> [[Amaris Reyes]]

- When headmaster Reyes was a student at [[Higher Education]], Cecelia was an exchange student. They met and dated.
- A cult attacked CMR and did a lot of damage. Among the dead was Reyes' best friend's [[Saella Brunidottir]]'s dead girlfriend [[# Ramona da Regalado]] who was decapitated as a political statement (she was a princess and likely queen-to-be of [[Umlilo]])
- Cecelia didn't understand why everyone was so upset and simply puppeteered the head back onto the body in an attempt to cheer up her friends, upsetting everyone around her.
- This was the beginning of the tensions between Erzeung and [[Pensier]]
