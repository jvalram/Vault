# The Radiant Deliverance

The sun dragon and original founder of the nation now known as "[[Nations/Mulvao/Aukamen/Raj/Raj|Raj]]", [[Sesur-sati]], was a proud and powerful leader of the then called nation "Sesur."

As time passed, Sesur-sati's pride turned into vanity and his power into wrath. The people of Sesur began to suffer at his rule and begged for a savior to release them from his reign.

One day, as the sun shone blindingly bright, a man, [[Pharaoh Pashet|Pashet]], was visited by a [[Peaqui]]. The peaqui opened its beak and spoke. It told Pashet that now was the time to free the people of Sesur-sati's reign. That the true god, the sun, Raj, wanted the people to reclaim the land and that Pashet was Raj's chosen leader to deliver its people from the tyrannical claws of the false god, [[Sesur-sati]].  

It would seem the people's prayers were being answered as the sun itself, Raj, had sent the peaqui to deliver upon Pashet its message.

The next day, as the sun shone brightly from its place in the sky, Pashet, was greeted by an [[Anunoth]]. The anunoth gifted a vision to Pashet. A vision in which the sun shone brightly over the palace of Sesur-sati as he lead the charge against the tyrant dragon. 

It would seem the people's prayers were being answered as the sun itself, Raj, had sent the anunoth to deliver upon Pashet the plans to execute its will.

The next day, as the sun hung high in the sky and struck all with its glory, Pashet was visited by an [[Arunshoa]]. The arunshoa was not alone, for it had brought with it nearly an army's worth of its kind. The biggest, strongest one took a bow. The rest of the arunshoa followed. 

The lead arunshoa then spoke, telling Pashet to rally the people and prepare. It would seem the people's prayers were being answered as the sun itself, Raj, had sent the arunshoa to deliver upon Pashet its soldiers.

Pashet spent the next seven days rallying the people, preaching of Raj and the holy sun's planned deliverance of the faithful.

On the 10th day, the peaqui, the anunoth, and the arunshoa arrived along Pashet as he and his soldiers came upon the steps of the palace. With their help, the people were able to storm the palace and slay Sesur-sati, putting his tyrannical reign to an end.

As Sesur-sati's corpse shattered into a flux of magical sun energy, the peaqui, anunoth, and arunshoa took some of the free energy and blessed Pashet. Those who were there to bear witness rejoiced and proclaimed him their king.

In honor of the god who had sent its servants to help overthrow the tyrant, Sesur was renamed to "Raj."

To honor those servants, Pharaoh Pashet established the Higher Ringâ€”a group of three advisors who would serve the Pharaoh. Each one was to be a paragon of the roles the original three mythical creatures took on: The Messenger (Royal Diplomat), The Will (Royal Advisor), and The Soldier (Royal General).
