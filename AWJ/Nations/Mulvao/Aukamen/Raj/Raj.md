Although the vast deserts of Raj can be difficult to navigate and have a plethora of buried dungeons filled with secrets, the oases where establishments are settled are natural paradises rich with history and culture.

The people of Raj are referred to as Raji

Raj is considered a #1st-world nation
#### Topography

Savannahs with a big desert that starts in the center of the nation that extends eastward and southward. The desert does go as far as to touch the gulf area between Raj/[[Erzeung]]. 

This area is an oasis. This are is very densely populated and is known to be a big port area and general tourist trap given the favorable and scenic conditions and sights.
#### Education

Raj has a national education system that runs from k-12, just like the other nations of Aukamen. 

The full length of this system is reinforced everywhere, even small towns at least having one high school in it. The nation prides itself in its knowledge, a plethora of colleges, university, law schools, and magical academies being not only available to attend, but highly encouraged to. 

Many well paying jobs require degrees that can only be obtained through means of higher education.

#### Religion

Within Raj, there are two notable sects to religion. 

The first are "Beholders of [[Deities/Gods/Raj|Raj]]". This is the most popular religion in Raj, making up around 75% of the population. This religion is unique in that it does not branch off from any doctrine. Rather, its origins can be traced to the events of Raj's liberation—"[[The Radiant Deliverance]]." 

The sun itself, Raj, is revered and worship for aiding the people in overthrowing [[Sesur-sati]]. Grand temples honoring Raj can be found in almost any city or town, ranging in size and intricacy depending on the location. 

The most pious of devotees attend service every day to worship Raj, but the average devotee typically attend service on the first, second, third, and tenth day of every moon as Raj's graciousness to its people is recounted. 

The second are believers of the [[Velesteus Doctrine]]. This religion makes up about 15% of the population. Altars and temples for this faith can usually be found in immigrant communities.

#### Trade and Industry 

In terms of industries, Raj is best known for its booming fish, mineral, gemstone, jewelry, and oil industries. Raj is major trade partners with [[Erzeung]], [[Pensier]], [[Umlilo]], and [[Shuǐeh]].
#### Adventuring Culture

Unlike the majority of the nations in [[Aukamen]], Raj's adventuring culture fairs well. 

The vast deserts that hide away dungeons, tombs, and crypts from a bygone era are the perfect call for adventure. 

The government of Raj also has its own dedicated branch for dealing with magical threats for those with an adventuring heart that prefer a more stable job and income.
#### Politics

Raj can be described as a monarchy. 

The Pharaoh, the head figure and leader of the nation, comes to power whenever the previous Pharaoh either retires or passes away. The heir is typically the previous Pharaoh's legitimate firstborn.

The current line of Pharaohs can be traced all the way back to the very first Pharaoh: [[Pharaoh Pashet]]. 

Helping the Pharaoh in leading the nation are the **Higher Ring: a selective group of three advisors.** 

The first member, the **Messenger**, acts as a Royal Diplomat. They oversee all matters of diplomacy regarding the royal family or Raj as a whole nation on both a national and international scale. 

The second member, the **Will**, acts as a Royal Advisor. They suggest the optimal course of action for the Pharaoh to take using their vast knowledge and experience. 

The third member, the **Soldier**, acts as a Royal General. They are in charge of the Pharoah's army and are skilled in war tactics.

#### Naming Conventions

There are two types of names that can be commonly found within Raj. 

The first subset are names reminiscent of those found in Ancient Egypt. However, it should be noted that amongst middle and lower class people, names do not exceed two syllables.

Names with three or more syllables are typically reserved for the aristocracy and royalty. 

The second subset are names reminiscent of of those found in modern day Egypt. These names do not seem to come with the same type of societal restrictions that the first subset does.
#### Funeral Rites

Funeral rites vary based on socioeconomic class. 

The non-nobles/royalty usually have a small ceremony, typically a feast featuring the favorite foods of the deceased as participants recount stories and memories. A serving is made for the deceased which lays in an empty seating spot, untouched for the course of the ceremony. 

Upon the following sunrise, the deceased is buried beneath the sands of the desert to return from which it once came, buried with the meal intended for them. 

For nobles and royalty, a grand ceremony is held celebrating the deceased's life. This ceremony features a grand feast, party games, a favorite activity of the deceased, prayers of thanks to Raj for the person's life, and if possible, a memorium stone of the deceased's memories will be showcased. 

Following this ceremony, the entombment ceremony will commence upon the completion of the embalmment of the deceased. The deceased will be placed into a sarcophagus that is symbolic and representative of the deceased before being stowed away in its own personalized room in the nearest Temple of the Dead. 

This second ceremony is a much more private affair, usually limited to family and close friends of the deceased.
