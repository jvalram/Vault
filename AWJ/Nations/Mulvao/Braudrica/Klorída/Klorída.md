**Klorída** is a growing nation in the center of [[Braudrica]]. Flora magic naturally courses through the land here. 

Here, the people live in perfect harmony with the living land that the dragon [[Allmother]] is said to have sacrificed herself to become in order to protect the people of Klorída.

The people of Klorída are referred to as Klorídian

Klorída is considered a #2nd-world nation
#### Topography

Klorída is a nation known for its incredibly dense forests. These forests take up a majority of the land with the occasional exception of a grassy clearing or a lake. 

On the southern border shared with Hava and Åskvädjr lie the [[Cruel Mountains]] that prevent the wild forests of Klorída from expanding southward. 

However, this natural barrier does not protect Terra’s land from being overtaken with forests—forests that Klorídans believe they have a right to claim as a blessing of the [[Allmother]].
##### Cities

In Klorída, most people typically live in small communities of about 20-50 people. Such communities take up residence amongst the trees in treehouse communities, in clearings with a babbling brook nearby, and in more marsh like areas, small houses are built on stilts and are connected by wooden platforms. 

There a few larger cities however that have cleared some of the precious forest in exchange for making more modern architecture similar to the more “fancier” houses and mansions that can be found in nations like Shuǐeh, Umlilo, Raj, Pensier, and Erzeung. 

However, plant life has managed to grow back quickly in these cities, often overrunning the cities with thick tree branches and an abundance of flowers. 

As such, these larger cities have a bit of a naturalistic and whimsical touch to them—modernity coexisting with nature.
#### Trade and Industry

In terms of industries, Klorída is best known for its booming botany, herbs, traditional medicine, and veggies/fruits industries.

Klorída is major trade partners with [[Shuǐeh]], [[A'lune]], [[Hava]], and [[Pensier]].
#### Education

Klorída, being a 2nd world country, does have a national education system. However, this required education only lasts about 5 grades.

It should be noted that Klorída is unique in its curriculum in that the [[Allmother]] has an entire subject dedicated to her. This subject is simply referred to as "Gospel" in which the history of the Allmother is taught, along with her teachings of kindness, altruism, and serenity. 

Within Gospel, the subject of familiars are also briefly brought up as witches are taught about the incredible bond that exists between familiars and witches, as the Allmother was the one to both bless and introduce the concept of bonding to her children.

In general, nearly everyone attends school. However, less than a third of graduates go on to continue their education outside of Klorída—most just go on to either adventure or work.
#### Adventuring Culture

Adventuring is seen as a great thing for the youth of Klorída. In fact, adventuring tends to be encouraged as a valid career choice aside from an encouragement to become temple attendants or natural healers (mainly in aromatherapy and herbal medicine).

Adventuring is encouraged as it is seen as a chance for one to explore themselves and the bountiful land the [[Allmother]] sacrificed herself twice for. To adventure and explore Klorída is to honor the Allmother's sacrifices by enjoying her bounties.

#### Politics

Klorída is officially recognized as a **confederacy**.

However, it is a confederacy in a rather loose sense as Klorída lacks any states, provinces, or counties within its borders. Rather, the leaders of major cities are nationally recognized to be on Klorída's confederate board. The leader of this board is the mayor of the capital, [[Lapicos]]. This leader is the one to guide meetings and is the international face of the confederate board, but they do not have any special veto powers.

Every 6 months, all of these leaders convene in the capital, Lapicos, to discuss governmental and both national and international politics.

It should be noted, however, that the confederate board has several requirements for its members. Any leader of a major city that does not meet all of these requirements are not officially recognized to be on the confederate board and are not given an invitation to the bi-annual meetings:

- Must be over 60 years old
- Must be born in Klorída
- Must have lived in Klorída for at least 40 years
- Must have been in position of leadership (or preparing/interning for it) for at least 5 years
#### Naming Conventions

In Klorída, two types of names stand out as being the most common type of name.

The first are names that either match or are similar to the name of plants.

The second are names that are similar to the names associated with Ancient Greece.
#### Topography

Death is but another beginning in Klorída. The deceased is wrapped in natural fiber cloth and brought to an empty spot in the deceased's favorite forest spot. 

A suitable hole is dug into the ground to bury the deceased along with a seed—usually of the deceased's favorite plant—placed right on top of the cloth. 

A prayer is then made to the [[Allmother]] thanking her for the deceased's life and wishing them well in the next stage of their life. 

From there, a flora magic user present at the ceremony will accelerate the buried seed's growth using nutrition provided by the deceased's body, bringing the plant to full bloom.
