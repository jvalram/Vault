#### Pandorea, the First Flora Dragon

[[Pandorea]] fostered her land like a mother would to her child. Klorída bloomed under her watch—beautifully so. 

She was beloved by the people, and she loved the people. However, Klorída would also be forcibly dragged into the war to claim Braudrica (a war that would later be known in the history books as the [[Genesi of Braudrica]]), started by [[Hrærek]] and [[Aristides]], and against those two power hungry and war crazed dragons, Pandorea didn't stand much of a chance. 

Klorída was being caught in the crossfire, land and nature and people alike being destroyed. So instead of trying to fight them back, she sacrificed herself, fusing herself into the very earth itself and in a sense, literally becoming [[Klorída]]. 

With this sacrifice, the flora of Klorída became heavily infused with magic and became alive and empowered. Every invader or harm that tried to step into [[Klorída]] was promptly dealt with by the flora of the land itself. 

To this date, those that try to enter Klorída with extreme malicious intent find themselves having to answer to the flora of Klorída.

Amongst Klorídans, Pandorea is remembered and revered as the Mother of Klorída and a god of family and love. Klorídans affectionately refer to her as the "**Allmother**" (Mother of All). 

This is a title only Klorídans refer to Pandorea as. **Foreigners referring to Pandorea as such is typically frowned upon and seen as incredibly disrespectful.**

#### World's Calamity

During the [[World's Calamity]], Klorída saw its flora turning on the people, wrecking havoc on people, buildings, anything. Soil became incredibly infertile and earthquakes of high magnitudes were frequent. The coastlines were also swallowed by tsunamis, completely drowning the set of islands that Klorída used to have on its coast.

Knowing her people were in danger, Pandorea rose up from beyond the gates of death itself to aid her people in the time of their most dire need. 

She, along with brave heroes such as [[Nesaea of Orchembria]] and [[Phaethusa of Thoregea]], were able to keep Klorída standing until World's Calamity was resolved in part to Pandorea's valiant sacrifice—the second one she would make for the sake of Klorída. 

Today, nearly every Klorídan reveres the Allmother to varying degrees in gratitude for the love and sacrifices she has made for her people.
