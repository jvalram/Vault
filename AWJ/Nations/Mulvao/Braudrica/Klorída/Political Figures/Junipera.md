## BIO

Junipera is a full flora witch with a squirrel and a bear as her familiars. 

She's based in [[Klorída]] but has no real home, constantly on the move as an adventurer. She's renowned not just for being a High Witch, but for also being a rescuer, always diving in to help adventurers and non-adventurers alike in danger, along with being a great guide for traversing the ever growing and changing forests that sprawl across Klorída. 

She attributes all of her success and her kinda and generous demeanor to the [[Allmother]].
