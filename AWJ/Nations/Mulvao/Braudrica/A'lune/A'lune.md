**A'lune** is a small nation on the northeast side of [[Braudrica]]. Moon magic naturally courses through the land here. 

Once known as the nation of Rauceveth from an era gone by, the nation of A'lune is known for its churches, the [[Pool of Velesteus]], and thriving demon hunting business.

The people of A'lune are referred to as A'lunian

A'lune is considered a #2nd-world nation

#### Cities and Topography

The nation of A'lune primarily consist of taigas across the mainland with dense forests spread throughout, especially in the center. 

The north coast and west border is home to the Freqienles mountain range—a mountain range known for its steep mountains with sharp and dangerous cliffs, though they're considered more forgiving than the [[Cruel Mountains#^691cc1|Cruel Mountains of Hava]]

The islands of A'lune off the northeast coast are known to be idyllic forest paradises littered with springs and tall grasses.

The capital of A'lune is Saint Constance.
#### Trade and Industry

In terms of industries, A'lune is best known for its booming cotton, wool, moon-enchanted textiles, anti-demon wards, and fish industries. 

A'lune is major trade partners with [[Kjølik]], [[Terra]], [[Shuǐeh]], [[Hava]], [[Klorída]], and [[Umlilo]].
#### Education

A'lune does have a national education system. 

However, this required education only lasts about 8 grades. In general, nearly everyone attends school. 

Post-graduation, about half of graduates go on to become demon/vampire hunters. 1/3 go on to become a devotee of the Church of [[Constance|Saint Constance]] and the other 1/6 either further their education elsewhere or settle down into a relatively "normal" life/job
#### Adventuring Culture

The adventuring culture of A'lune is a thriving one. 

Although most of [[Braudrica]] tends to get associated as an adventurer's paradise, A'lune is internationally recognized as the largest hub for adventurers. 

This association is primarily made due to the amount of [[Demon|demons]] in the nation—a popular sport of choice for adventurers who want a bit more danger and thrill to their endeavors.

Due to the amount of demons A'lune deals with, numerous demon hunting guilds have cropped up across the nation, offering salaries for members and hunt postings for all to participate in.
#### Politics

#### Fashion

There are two primary "fashion sects" within A'lune.

The first is a more simple yet elegant type of dress. This is the type of dress that is typically preferred amongst the general populace. 

Clothing is typically all white, a light pastel blue/purple, or a slightly desaturated blue/purple. Most of the clothing is free from any patterns, but sometimes there is embroidery or borders bearing golds or darker hues of purple/blue. 

The material of the clothes itself tends to be very loose and breathable. The symbol of the moon is the only pattern that can be commonly seen amongst clothing of this particular "fashion sect".

The second is gothic. Demon/vampire hunters/slayers/exorcists take up this fashion style, being a big fan of the color black, long billowy capes, multiple belts, boots, ominous looking hats, and [[Holy Masks]].
#### Naming Conventions

Names in A'lune are typically reminiscent of French names.
#### Funeral Rites

A ceremony of mourning is often performed for the deceased at a local [[Church of Saint Constance]]. 

This ceremony typically features a prayer to [[Constance|Saint Constance]] thanking her for the deceased's life before turning the podium over to the deceased's close friends and family to say whatever words they wish to about the deceased. 

After these short speeches, a priest will take over the podium once more to pray to [[Constance|Saint Constance]] that she receive the soul of the deceased. 

From there, all attendees will follow the priest into the catacombs that lay beneath the church and say their final goodbyes as the deceased is left to rest in a tomb.
