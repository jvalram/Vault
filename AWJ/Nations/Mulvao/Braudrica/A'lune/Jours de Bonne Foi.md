**ORIGIN:** #alune 

**Jours de Bonne Foi** is a three-day holiday originating from [[A'lune]]. 

**On the 30th of the Simurgh Moon**, the streets of A'lune alight with fairs and festivals in anticipation for the 31st. 

Vendors set up shops with gift packages, trinkets, and food whilst decorating the streets with motifs of the moon and [[Constance|Saint Constance]]. Fun and family friendly carnival games are also set up for all to enjoy. The people also take to caroling and ice skating as fun activities to celebrate. 

On this day, the church also sanctions a celebratory hunt for all hunters and adventurers to join. At noon, all who wish to participate gather at their local church. The priest will then give a speech, thanking the hunters and adventurers for keeping A'lune safe from evil. The priest will then cast a blessing upon all present to have a temporary stronger resistance to dark magic and increased effectiveness against it as well. With that, the hunt to cleanse A'lune from as much evil as possible within the next six hours begins. 

At the end of the time, all participants return back to the church and are welcomed to a free celebratory feast prepared by the church in the time the hunt was ongoing.

**On the morning of the 31st of the Simurgh Moon**, all who place their sincere faith and allegiance in Saint Constance will find a personalized gift from Saint Constance herself in their gift-receival (a place in the home that has been set-up to receive gifts, marked with a rosary of Saint Constance). 

To show gratitude for the gift, it is tradition to pass on the kindness and generosity of Saint Constance by giving out gifts to all. The church also passes on this goodwill by providing free gifts to all who come visit the church on this day. 

>This day is also one in which going to the confessionals at the church is highly encouraged in order to start the new year with a fresh, clean slate. 

The end of the day is marked by a traditional sermon that starts around 10:00 pm. The priest wraps up the year and gives it one final blessing.

**At midnight of the 1st of Unicorn Moon**, the priest leads attendants into the new year with a new blessing. The sermon concludes with instruction to spend the first day of the new year with family and loved ones. This is traditionally celebrated with a grand feast at home. 

To those without family or loved ones to celebrate with, the church also hosts a free feast for all to come to on this day.

With the Church of Saint Constance's widespread international reach, the holiday is also commonly celebrated in [[Terra]], [[Shu«êeh]], [[Hava]] and [[Pensier]] but can also be found in religious communities of Saint Constance in other nations. 

These international versions of the holiday are often celebrated *non-religiously* and only celebrate the 31st of the Simurgh Moon. 

**Only those who are of faith to Saint Constance celebrate it religiously for the full three days.**
