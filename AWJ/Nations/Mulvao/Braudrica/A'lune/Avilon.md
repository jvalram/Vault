**Avilon** is a quaint city in [[A'lune]] surrounded by thick forest. 

It is best known for the [[Académie Avilon]]—an academy for all walks of life that is commonly regarded as the best place for education in all of A'lune. 

As such, the general populace has a rather odd lack of adventurers and demon hunters for a city in A'lune.
