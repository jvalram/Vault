The [[Cathédrale Constance]] in [[A'lune]] houses a sacred pond said to be created by the old creator god [[Velesteus]] when they created the world anew. 

The pond will grant ANY wish with a positive intent during a lunar eclipse and ANY wish with a nefarious intent during a solar eclipse.

Any strong wish with a **positive** intent can be granted during a full moon, and any strong wish with a **nefarious** intent can be granted during a new moon.

A person may only make one wish to the pond in their entire lifetime. If a person attempted to make a second wish, the wish would simply go unheard, no matter what it is.

----

Said Cathedral is extremely well guarded and exclusive. 

In order to be able to make a wish, one must write a formal request to their local priest at a [[Church of Saint Constance]]. The priest will then review it and determine whether or not to forward it to the archbishop in Saint Constance, [[A'lune]]. 

The bishop will then review the formal request. If the request is approved, a form is then sent back to the local priest for the wisher to pick up and fill out. 

This form is then sent back to the Cathédrale Constance and reviewed by either the Pope or a board of Cardinals depending on the nature of the wish. 

If the wish is approved, one final letter is sent to the wisher providing a date and time to arrive at the Cathédrale Constance in A'lune to perform the wish. This date and time is typically non-negotiable.
