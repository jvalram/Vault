Holy Masks are typically carved out from the bark of the Aerodsuier treeâ€”an ethereal looking willow tree known for its incredibly sturdy off white colored bark.

All the masks that have the symbol of the moon on it are imbued with a bit of moon magic. This magic acts as a protection against dark magic, allowing the wearer to mitigate a small portion of the damage that dark magic incurs. 

Some masks have demon horns attached to them for aesthetic purposes. The magic imbued in the masks also helps to make the horns harmless. Typically, demon appendages carry a lot of demonic energy within them that over time, if exposed to frequently for extended amounts of time, can drive a person to madness.

The markings on the mask is the origin point for the magic imbued. If the marking is destroyed, then the mask looses its magical properties.
