#### Old Shuǐeh

Old Shuǐeh is like an isolated bubble trapped in time – aesthetically and culturally, this area still resembles what life in Shuǐeh was like before the event known as [[World's Calamity]]. 

The emperor who rules over Shenlong is placated by being able to live out the fantasy of holding onto the pre-calamity era of Shuieh, along with the royal emperors family. 

All other Shuǐan provinces are run by members of [[Shuǐeh#The Circle of Advisors|Circle of Advisors]]. Shenlong is the only province the Emperor has any "real" power over in the alleged name of "preserving the culture of Shuǐeh." It's such an insular bubble to the point where the province of Shenlong actually has a wall defining its border with entry checkpoints and border control. 

Not just anyone can enter/leave. You'll require special governmental permission from either Shenlong's internal government or the [[Shuǐeh#The Circle of Advisors|Circle of Advisors]].
