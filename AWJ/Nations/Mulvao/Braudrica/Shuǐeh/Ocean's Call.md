# The Ocean's Call

"The Ocean's Call" (or "Xuefeng's Call" by Shuǐehi) is a biannual tidal event that occurs all across Mulvao at the same time. 

The waters worldwide are known to become especially dangerous and volatile around this time with violent crashing waves and constantly rocky waters. It is known to be a tidal event which sparks a compulsion amongst all full-blooded waterborne species to return to their native waters. 

This event and period of return typically lasts about a month long. During this tidal event, the waters teem with more magical energy than usual. In some cases, certain spots can even become temporary **Water Magic Hotspots**. 

Besides the extra energy empowering participating waterborne species during the tidal event, the extra energy also allows them the benefit of quicker healing. 

> Those who ignore the compulsion are noted to be afflicted with a deep longing for the ocean, one that is comparable to an intense homesickness. 

The longer an individual goes without participating in the tidal event the more all-consuming the longing for the ocean becomes until the individual is barely a person outside of their desire to return to the ocean. 

It is possible to recover from this condition by spending the amount of tidal events missed in the ocean consecutively (ex. If you missed 5 tidal events, you could recover by staying in the water for the duration of 5 tidal events back to back [including the 10 months off-time] without ever leaving the water. So in total, to recover from 5 missed tidal events, a person would need to stay in their native waters for 2.5 years without ever leaving said native waters). 

Coincidentally, plenty of familiars of an aquatic species also tend to be born around this time of year.
