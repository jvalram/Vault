**Shuǐeh** is a nation on the southwest side of [[Braudrica]]. Water magic naturally courses through the land here. 

People in the continent of [[Aukamen]] often refer to Shuǐeh as the "Gem of [[Braudrica]]" for its rapid modernization and bountiful natural resources that rival that of Aukamen.

**[[Quanhai]]** is the capital of Shuǐeh. All other cities listed are large cities. Smaller cities and towns are not included in this map.

The people of Shuǐeh are referred to as Shuǐan

Shuǐeh is considered a #1st-world nation
#### Topography

The nation of Shuǐeh is generally known to be very beachy and coastal. Most settlements are along the shores of Shuǐeh. 

The gulf on the nation's east coast is especially notable for it's three grand waterfalls—a sight widely considered to be a sight worth seeing in one's lifetime across all of Mulvao. 

The area around these grand waterfalls are home to dense jungles. 

The inland of Shuǐeh, aside from the northern jungles, are mostly swamps. However, the northern border that is shared with Terra is grassland.

#### Education

Shuǐeh does have a national education system that runs from k-12. It is the only nation in Braudrica to have a k-12 system. However, the full length of this system is only truly enforced within more modernized, urban areas.

Within rural areas of Shuǐeh, local schoolhouses typically only teach up to 8th grade before referring the child to the closest high school—typically one in an urban area. However, the government will not attempt to enforce this transfer in rural areas for lack of resources. So long as the student stays within a rural area or takes on a profession that does not require a high school diploma of them, the student will not typically face any repercussions for failing to complete their mandated education. 

However, in more urban areas, high school diplomas are required for a vast majority of jobs that pay well. 

For jobs that pay even more, degrees are often required. In the modernized parts of Shuǐeh, colleges and universities are relatively common.

Shuǐeh is home to one of "[[The Big Three]]" in terms of higher education options for magic users. 

Shuǐeh's [[University of Tsentoori]] is one of "The Big Three". It is highly regarded as an excellent option for magic users wanting to seriously improve their magic. 

Located in the underwater city of Tsentoori, the school is known for its lavish marble architecture, scenic underwater view, and its impressive alumni, being the home school of a number of High Witches throughout history.
#### Religion

Within Shuǐeh, there are four notable sects to religion.

The first are "Servants of [[Xuefeng]]." This is the most popular religion in Shuǐeh, making up around 45% of the population. It is a branch off from the [[Doctrine of The Eleven]]. This religion focuses on the worship of the founder and first Emperor of Shuǐeh—the water dragon Xuefeng. 

A temple honoring Xuefeng can be found in almost any city or town, ranging in size and intricacy depending on the location. Devotees attend these temples on the first day of every moon as a spiritual leader prays to Xuefeng for a successful and prosperous moon to come.

The second is agnosticism/atheism. A lack of faith makes up around 25% of the population.

The third are "Disciples of [[Constance|Saint Constance]]". This religion makes up about 15% of the population. It is a branch off from the Doctrine of The Eleven. 

In some big cities of Shuǐeh, churches devoted to [[Constance|Saint Constance]] can be found. Most devotees of this faith are noted to be immigrants from [[A'lune]].

The fourth are believers of the [[Velesteus Doctrine]]. This religion makes up about 5% of the population. Altars and temples for this faith are hard to come by in more urban areas as those who subscribe to this faith tend to live in the more rural parts of Shuǐeh.
#### Trade and Industry

In terms of industries, Shuǐeh is best known for its booming fish, rice, vegetable, fruit, and magically potent water industries.

Shuǐeh is major trade partners with [[Erzeung]], [[Pensier]], [[Umlilo]], [[Terra]], [[Klorída]], and [[A'lune]].
#### Adventuring Culture

Shuǐan culture isn't too big on adventuring. It's thought to be a sort of thing that's an activity of the barbaric past. 

Shuǐeh strives to be on par with the state of [[Aukamen]]—particularly Erzeung. As such, anything modern is coveted and anything traditionalistic that doesn't fit nicely into the modern aesthetic of things is looked down on. 

However, this is not the case in more rural areas where old tradition is clung onto tightly—particularly in the province of [[Shenlong]] (a region commonly referred to as "Old Shuǐeh").

Those wishing to be adventurers usually find themselves moving out of the country or traveling to more rural areas where adventuring work is much more abundant. Some also go on to work for the government as Shuǐeh does have a dedicated branch for dealing with magical threats such as demons.
#### Politics

Although originally a monarchy (and technically still is), the nation of Shuǐeh can best be described as a **plutocracy** nowadays.

The royal family, the Zhào family, lives in the Shuǐ Palace located in Qingdao. The royal family dates all the way back to [[World's Calamity]], the previous monarch and rightful heirs having died during the event. 

The nephew of the previous monarch, Sungki Zhào, was able to take control and stabilize the nation, hence shifting Shuǐeh from the Tokko dynasty into the Zhào dynasty.

##### The Circle of Advisors

Before the death of [[Xuefeng|Emperor Xuefeng]], All members of the Circle of Advisors are hand selected by the Emperor and retain their spots until they choose to retire or are fired by the Emperor.

This Circle of Advisors is primarily comprised of friends of the royal family and the nation's wealthiest people.

After [[Xuefeng|Emperor Xuefeng]] dies in battle, the royal family ends up getting ascended to emperor – completely unprepared for the role and resulting in instant financial troubles. 

Where the true power lies is in the royal family's Circle of Advisors. To those who pay close attention to the nation's politics, it is somewhat of an open secret that this Circle of Advisors are the puppet masters of the current Emperor. 

The emperor's vassals become more and more desperate for money. They fall to corruption and literally sell their positions in the circle to the highest bidders. These bidders are most often nobility or rich business men whose riches mostly come from business with [[Aukamen]].

This business with Aukamen leads to the exchange of cultural ideas, which then leads to modernization. The plutocracy solidifies itself as the vassalship of the empire becomes a product – now a council of the riches people in the nation vs. the emperor they all collectively have the power to overthrow at any moment. 



The emperor is very much aware of their position, but in a want to keep their title, land, and power (the little they have), they're under the thumb of the council.

#### Naming Conventions

There are generally 3 types of names within Shuǐeh.

The first subset of names are reminiscent of Chinese names.

The second subset of names are reminiscent of Korean names.

The third subset of names are reminiscent of Japanese names.
#### Funeral Rites

A single ceremony is held at the shore of open waters. 

The deceased is placed inside of a decorated gondola, dressed in ceremonial garb—usually loose fitting, elegant, sheer blue fabric. Stories and memories of the deceased are shared around before wishing the deceased a final farewell. 

The people closest to the deceased will then push the gondola off into the sea, never to be seen again. 

For those who are able to using water magic or have hired someone who can, the people closest to the deceased and the magic user will push the gondola out into sea and follow it in their own ceremonially decorated gondolas. 

Once they reach a location out in the open sea with no land in sight, the magic user will manipulate the water to have it gently swallow the boat and its deceased passenger whole, serenely ensuring a burial at sea.
