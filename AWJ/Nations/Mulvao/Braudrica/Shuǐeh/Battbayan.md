# Battbayan

Battbayan was a small village located in northern [[Shuǐeh]] that was home exclusively to non-magical human assassins. Founded during the [[Xuefeng]] dynasty, the village was started by a band of highly trained and practiced human assassins who had pledged their loyalty to [[Xuefeng|Emperor Xuefeng]]. 

These mercenaries would offer their blades to Xuefeng and whoever else could afford the human embodiment of a weapon. 

After Xuefeng was killed in 114 NW ([[Xuefeng#**Death of Xuefeng**|see: Death of Xuefeng]]), the mercenaries of Battbayan repledged their allegiance to Xuefeng's proclaimed successor—[[Yoshika Tokko]]. 

Battbayan would keep its allegiance to the royal family throughout the Tokko dynasty but would find its services spurred by the Zhào dynasty as the first Emperor of the Zhào dynasty, [[Sungki Zhào]], felt the need for assassins unbecoming for the new Shuǐeh he was building. 

Ever since then, Battbayan had continued to outsource its assassins to those who could afford it, but as the modernization of Shuǐeh continued, buyers became less and less, eventually leaving Battbayan penniless. 

Before the village was forced to disband in the face of financial ruin, the entire population of the village was massacred.

#### Tenets of Battbayan

Life within the village was incredibly harsh and strict. All members of the village were to uphold the **"Tenets of Battbayan"**—a set of rules as to how life should be lived as a human weapon. 

These tenets were extremely strict, disallowing any individuality, personality, and emotional relationships. Daily life was filled with constant training and taking care of basic needs. 

Each member of the village was raised to be extensively trained in all traditional weapons, self defense, and ways to kill people.
