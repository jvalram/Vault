Terra has a reputation for being the "Wild West of Braudrica" given the constant strife between gangs trying to rise to power and peacekeepers trying to keep the nation unified under one name.

The people of Terra are referred to as Terreño

Terra is considered a #2nd-world nation
#### Topography

Generally, the nation of Terra primarily consists of long stretches of grasslands and savannas with a couple of forests—mostly along the border shared with [[Klorída]]. 

The northwest gulf is known to be home of beaches with powerful and unpredictable waves. The northernmost coast is mountainous with a plethora of cliffs that drop straight into the ocean. 

These mountains are a part of the Freqienles mountain range that extend into [[A'lune]].
#### Education

Terra does have a national education system. However, this required education only lasts about 6-8 grades depending on the territory.

Despite the relatively low amount of grades, not many people make it through in its entirety. As a nation, the attention of Terrans as a whole tends to not be on education. It is not uncommon for children to neglect attending school in favor of working on their family's farm, go straight into adventuring, or becoming a part of a gang.

Those who do end up completing their education and are interested in furthering it are encouraged to seek education out in a different nation as Terra lacks any higher education institutions. For those that are satisfied with their complete Terra education usually go on to become sheriffs or small business owners.
#### Religion

Within Terra, there are three notable sects to religion.

The first is agnosticism/atheism. A lack of faith makes up around 60% of the population.

The second are "[[Warriors of Earth]]". This religion makes up around 25% of the population. It is a branch off from the [[Doctrine of The Eleven]]. Those who follow this religion still honor and praise both [[Aristides]] and [[Cratos]], hoping to see the day the next draconic successor rise and reclaim the land Terra has lost over the centuries. 

This faith lacks a place of common place of worship or much of a structure to it, but the faith the people hold in the next dragon's coming is strong nonetheless.

The third are "[[Disciples of Saint Constance]]". This religion makes up about 10% of the population. It is a branch off from the [[Doctrine of The Eleven]]. In some big cities of [[Shuǐeh]], churches devoted to [[Constance|Saint Constance]] can be found. 

Most devotees of this faith are noted to be immigrants from [[A'lune]].
#### Trade and Industry

In terms of industries, Terra is best known for its booming livestock, metal, refined metal, wheat, and alcohol industries.

Terra is major trade partners with [[A'lune]], [[Hava]], [[Erzeung]], and [[Kjølik]].
#### Adventuring Culture

In the nation of Terra, adventuring is one of the most common occupations to have in a broad sense of the word. 

To Terra, an adventurer can range from a witch with a loaded gun causing a ruckus at the saloon every Tuesday or an asmokin hunting down [[Demon|demons]] with a loaded gun.

The nation also has its own government sponsored program for dealing with magical threats— a program that further incentives its citizens to take up a loaded gun.
#### Politics

The nation of Terra can be described as a **Confederacy**. 

The confederacy itself is split into four territories: Ticuato in the southwest, Guijito in the east, Campatez in the south, and Chiquimera in the north. 

All of these territories are run by governors. The means in which these governors obtain their title varies from territory to territory, but for the most part, elections are run. 

For the most part, these territories are run individually—what might be legal in one territory may not be in the next one over.

Every three moons, all of the governors will convene in the capital, Texipuca, to discuss the state of Terra as a whole and any international matters. To take any course of action as a nation, a majority vote must pass amongst the governors.
#### Naming Conventions

There are generally two types of names within Terra.

The first subset are names reminiscent of Spanish names.

The second subset are names reminiscent of Latino names.
#### Funeral Rites

Funeral rites in Terra are rather simple in nature. A level plane of land is selected as the burial site. 

Typically, established graveyards are the prime place for this, but some may choose to find their own section of land. 

Using earth magic, a site to place the deceased is created. The deceased is then placed in the site alongside any prized possessions of theirs before the site is then sealed off with earth magic. 

As a headstone marker, it is tradition to use earth magic to sculpt a monument of sorts out of the very earth the deceased now lays in.
