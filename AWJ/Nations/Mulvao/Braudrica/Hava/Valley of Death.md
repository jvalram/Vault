# Valley of Death

Valley of Deaths are defined as being a desolate piece of land entirely encapsulated in extremely dangerous and violent winds that are only penetrable by Guiding Winds and powerful air magic. Inside of them is essentially naught but a skeleton grave.

The valley of death is the final resting place for the people of [[Hava]], brought there by the [[Guiding Winds of Mourning]].
