**Hava** is a small nation on the southeast side of [[Braudrica]]. Air magic naturally courses through the land here. 

Hava is mostly known for three things: its infamous "[[Cruel Mountains]]" that runs along its northern border, the easygoing nature most everyone from Hava tends to have, and the [[Demirtekin|dragon that locals claim fly amongst those who can reach his heights]].

The people of Hava are referred to as Havanese

Hava is considered a #2nd-world nation
#### Topography

Hava primarily consists of canyons, mesas, and flat, arid deserts. 

Along the northern border shared with [[Klorída]] are the [[Cruel Mountains]]—a mountain range notorious for being extremely difficult to traverse due to its incredibly steep heights, narrow pathways, extremely volatile winds, and unreliable stability in every step taken on its jagged floors. 

Reaching the peak without a guide from the locals of the area is considered to be extremely dangerous, but incredibly admirable to those who seeks challenges like these in life. 

The coasts of Hava tend to be where a good portion of the population dwells as port cities in particular thrive in international trade with [[Aukamen]]. 

The canyons, mesas and [[Cruel Mountains]] are largely inhabited by the other notable portion of the nation's population—nomadic tribes.
#### Trade and Industry

In terms of industries, Hava is best known for its booming glass, wool, fish, and minerals industry.

Hava is major trade partners with [[Terra]], [[A'lune]], [[Shuǐeh]], [[Umlilo]], and [[Klorída]].
#### Education

Hava, being a 2nd world country, does have a national education system. However, this required education only lasts about 6 grades. 

Within Hava, people who live in cities and towns—mostly those along the coast—attend. However, within the canyons/mesas and the mountains, nomadic tribes are aplenty. 

Many of these tribes opt out of education entirely, others sending their children down to live in towns/cities until school is done and come back up.
#### Adventuring Culture

Within [[Braudrica]], adventuring/questing is still popular whereas in Aukamen it's less popular, people more into getting "real jobs" due to their relatively advanced infrastructure.

As a nation in Braudrica, Hava is home a fair amount of adventurers. The allure of the vast canyons and the challenge of the [[Cruel Mountains]] attracts many of its citizens into becoming adventurers.
#### Naming Conventions

There are generally 2 types of names within Hava.

The first subset of names are reminiscent of Turkish names.

The second subset of names are reminiscent of Mongolian names.
#### Funeral Rites

The funeral rites of Hava begin with the finding of the [[Guiding Winds of Mourning]]. These guiding winds are identifiable by their firm strength, the inexplicable weight of grief they carry, and the smell of desolation. 

They are often found at points of high altitude within Hava. Once a Guiding Wind of Mourning is found, the deceased is brought by family and close friends to the highest point the wind begins at. 

Along the journey, those present will take the time to reminisce about the deceased. Once the highest point is reached, all present will say their final goodbyes to the deceased. 

The deceased is then thrown off the point, the Guiding Winds of Mourning catching the deceased and bringing them to their final resting place—any one area of land known as a "Valley of Death." 

Valley of Deaths are defined as being a desolate piece of land entirely encapsulated in extremely dangerous and violent winds that are only penetrable by Guiding Winds and powerful air magic. Inside of them is essentially naught but a skeleton grave.
