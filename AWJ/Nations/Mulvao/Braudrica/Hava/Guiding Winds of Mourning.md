# Guiding Winds of Mourning
The funeral rites of [[Hava]] begin with the finding of the Guiding Winds of Mourning. 

These guiding winds are identifiable by their firm strength, the inexplicable weight of grief they carry, and the smell of desolation. They are often found at points of high altitude within Hava. 

Once a Guiding Wind of Mourning is found, the deceased is brought by family and close friends to the highest point the wind begins at. Along the journey, those present will take the time to reminisce about the deceased. 

Once the highest point is reached, all present will say their final goodbyes to the deceased. The deceased is then thrown off the point, the Guiding Winds of Mourning catching the deceased and bringing them to their final resting placeâ€”any one area of land known as a "[[Valley of Death]]."
