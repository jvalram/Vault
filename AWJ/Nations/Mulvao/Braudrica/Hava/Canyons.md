# Canyons

In the canyons of [[Hava]], there are two subsets of people—nomads and kanyonları.
#### **The Nomads**
**The nomadic tribes** of the canyons are few and scattered, constantly moving from place to place. 

They tend to be wary and elusive to outsiders, keeping to themselves and only interacting with other nomadic tribes and the kanyonları for trade and supplies. 

They tends to dress in loose garbs with a tight underclothing to prevent stray sand and debris from scraping their skin when the wind begins to fiercely howl through the canyons, along with insulating heat for freezing nights.

#### **The Kanyonları** 
**Kanyonları** are a more established people. They are much more common than nomadic tribes, but their settlements can be a bit hard to come by. 

This is because their settlements are carved directly into the walls of the canyons themselves. No home or building is ever truly "built"—it is all carved out from the walls of the canyons. The settlements themselves are comparable to a village or a town, just on a much smaller scale. 

Settlements tend to average 20-100 people. They also tend to dress similarly to the nomadic tribes with the difference of their clothing have much more variety in pattern and styles. 

The kanyonları often trade with other settlements, nomadic tribes, and are typically open to outsiders and exploring the world beyond the canyons.
