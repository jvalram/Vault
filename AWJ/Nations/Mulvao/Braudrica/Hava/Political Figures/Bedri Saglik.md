## BIO
Bedri is an air witch currently based in [[Hava]]. He is the current [[High Witch]] of Air in conjunction with his daytime occupation as an adventurer. He goes where the winds take him, never staying in one place for long.

He's a full air witch with an Andean condor as a familiar. 

He's was posed to become the chief of his nomadic tribe, but was recruited as a High Witch. Using the title to avoid responsibility back at home, Bedri spends his time traveling the world and getting some action. He does return home every now and then to check in on his family, though.
