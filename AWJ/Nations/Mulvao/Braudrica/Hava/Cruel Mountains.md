#### **Culture**: 

Each tribe has a different "specialty" that helps with relations and trading between each tribe. 

Each tribe is also associated with a color. the tribes don't have name yet BUT the colors are currently purple, dark green, light blue, black, gray, orange, and yellow. 

**Purple** specializes in handwoven ponchos and hats—common articles of clothing amongst all tribes. 

**Dark Green** specializes in "gardening", often being in supply of incredibly rare plants, roots, veggies. 

**Light blue** specializes in food, having a strong foodie culture and many techniques for preserving food.

**Black** specializes in smithery, taking commissions from other tribes. 

**Gray** specializes in brokering with harpies, being the only tribe to be made mostly up of [[Harpy#Oscen|Oscen]].  

**Orange** specializes in rare items. Amongst their people, several tribe members have an affinity for creation magic. 

**Yellow** specializes shelter equipment. They hand make tents and beddings to trade/sell off.
#### **Wildlife**: 

Both plants and animals are somewhat scarce given the harsh soil that makes sustainable farming near impossible. Hardy berry bushes can be found every now and then, along with the rare fruit tree. 

As for animals, goats, hares, yaks, and snow leopards are relatively "common"
#### **Communities**: 

No towns, just nomadic tribes. there's currently about 7 different tribes up there.
