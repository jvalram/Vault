#### Beginning

The world used to be one landmass known as Phiclai. In Phiclai, there were only two nations: [[Rauceveth]] and [[Kiagora]]. 

Since the beginning of time, the two nations had constantly been at war. Rauceveth aimed to send the world into anarchy—the ultimate freedom. Kiagora aimed to conquer the entire world—ensuring a controlled peace.

Leading the charge against Kiagora was a woman—[[Morgane]]. A legendary mercenary and leader of her own bandit troop in Rauceveth. Leading Kiagora was a man—[[Takemoto]]. King of his nation and a fearsome warrior and witch in his own right.

Morgane’s right hand was her daughter—[[Aurore]]. A witch of dark magic, her magic easily surpassed those who dared to fight her—it was said that she could have even taken over her own mother had she wanted to with ease. Beneath King Takemoto was his own daughter—[[Princess Hozumi]]. A witch of light magic, her ability to bend light was unparalleled.
#### Aurore and Princess Hozumi

During one fateful skirmish between the two nations, [[Aurore]] was kidnapped. She had been holding her own in the fight just fine until a bright light had consumed the battlefield. She had been blinded by the light, and while dazed, drugged and stolen away.

When she next woke, she found herself bound in cuffs, forced to kneel before King [[Takemoto]]. He goaded to her about her capture, sneering as she struggled against the cuffs and tried to use her magic against them to no avail. 

King Takemoto gave [[Aurore]] as a slave to [[Princess Hozumi]] as a gift, having recently loss his only daughter’s favor for his zealotry in trying to conquer Rauceveth.

Once Aurore was handed off to Princess Hozumi, Princess Hozumi had taken pity on Aurore. She did not believe this to be right in the least. She took off the cuffs gently, only for Aurore to immediately use her magic to threaten Princess Hozumi’s life in rage. 

However, Princess Hozumi was able to convince Aurore to cooperate with her for now. If Princess Hozumi was to die here, Aurore’s own death would not be far behind hers. Instead, if Aurore played the part of the slave, Princess Hozumi would find a way for Aurore to safely leave [[Kiagora]].

Aurore agreed to the plan, acting as a slave to Princess Hozumi. She mostly cleaned but was constantly accompanying the Princess wherever she went—per her majesty’s request. 

During this time spent together, planning for her escape, the two managed to grow close. Closer than either one of them could have expected. Despite the growing feelings, the two decided to keep their feelings secret to the other. Aurore was to leave after all. And once she went back to Rauceveth, she would go back to fighting against Kiagora. Against Princess Hozumi.

One night, the palace was stormed. Aurore had woken up at the sound, rushing to Princess Hozumi to protect her. On her way to the Princess’s room, she was intercepted by dark magic—casted by her own mother. Morgane revealed herself to Aurore, claiming to be bringing Aurore back home. The fight was over. They had managed to slit King Takemoto’s throat in his sleep and were off to make sure the Princess met the same fate.

Aurore refused. She blasted her mother away and ran for Princess Hozumi. Morgane recovered quickly, giving chase to Aurore, cursing her as a traitor. Morgane cast spell after spell to get Aurore to slow down or turn to fight her, but Aurore ignored her mother, taking several nasty hits if it meant not losing time on her way to Princess Hozumi.

When she managed to arrive at Princess Hozumi’s door, an assassin—one of her mother’s own bandits—hovered above Princess Hozumi’s sleeping form, knife in hand. Aurore quickly blasted the assassin off, but not before he swung down to slit her throat. The blast knocked the assassin off balance—the cut was made, but sloppily.

Aurore rushed to Princess Hozumi’s body, cradling her as Princess Hozumi gasped and chocked on her own blood. She desperately tried to use her magic to help, but dark magic simply did not heal. 

As Princess Hozumi laid there, dying, Aurore begged for whatever divine being was out there to save Princess Hozumi. Through her injuries, Princess Hozumi confessed her love to Aurore, wishing for a world born anew where peace could truly be had. Perhaps then, she could have loved Aurore freely. 

As Aurore’s tears begin to drop onto Princess Hozumi, the wound slowly began to close. Her prayers had been answered. Aurore also felt… different. Aurore looked down to her hands, casting a ball of darkness. However, instead of seeing the black and purple mass that usually formed, soft moonlight floated above her hand. She carefully placed ball to Princess Hozumi’s throat, watching the wound close up entirely.

The relief she had felt was overwhelming. Aurore kissed her beloved, and Princess Hozumi kissed back, a smile on her lips.

In that moment, the world shook and trembled as Aurore glowed with moonlight and Princess Hozumi glowed with sunlight. The glows grew stronger and stronger by the second as the kiss deepened.

The world was engulfed in light.
When the light settled, the world had been born anew.

#### Aftermath

[[Phiclai]] had split into three—[[Braudrica]], [[Kjølik]], and [[Aukamen]]. All dark magic had evolved into magic of the moon, and all light magic had evolved into magic of the sun. This event is referred to as [[The Great Migration]].

[[Aurore]] and [[Princess Hozumi |Hozumi]] were said to have moved back to the new left continent of [[Braudrica]], returning to [[Rauceveth]]. When Aurore arrived home, she came across a mysterious pond that beckoned her forth, asking what it was she and Hozumi wished for most. 

What they asked for remains unknown to this day, but scholars believe they asked for a family, as shortly after, Aurore and Hozumi were gifted with eleven eggs at their doorstep.

From these eggs, the first [[Dragons|dragons]] were born. And with their birth, new magics flooded the lands. 

From the dragons born, magic of ice, flora, fire, water, earth, mind, creation, air, and lightning were created. Alongside the new elements, dragons of moon and sun were also born. 

When the dragons were all born, it is said that a burst of magical energy like no other ran across the world, touching all life forms—even giving some the ability to use a certain type of magic.

From the creation of new magics, all non-human [[Species]] were suddenly birthed into existence alongside the magics.

Aurore and Hozumi raised these dragons as if they were their own kin. Having human parents and learning the ways of human cultures, the dragons gained the ability to shift their forms into that of humans.

The dragons were incredibly adept at their respective magic, showing a level of understanding and power never seen before. It was as if they were the core of magic itself.

When the dragons had all reached a mature age, they bid their mothers good-bye in order to follow a calling in their souls they had felt since birth. The urge to be where they belonged.

And so, the dragons journey all across the world, looking for the place which they belonged. Along the way, some of them made enemies whereas others made friends.

The dragons all ended up finding the land that called to them and claimed it as their own. Some were never heard from again whereas other went on to found new nations that exist today—such as [[A'lune]], [[Nations/Mulvao/Aukamen/Raj/Raj|Raj]], [[Pensier]], and [[Åskvädjr]]. 

Those who founded nations were typically very involved in their nations—even being rulers in most cases. However, as age approached them, they passed their leadership down and disappeared, never to be seen again.
