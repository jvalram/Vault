A witch of dark magic, which easily surpassed those who dared to fight her. Once [[Morgane|Morgane's]] right hand, it was said that she could have even taken over her own mother had she wanted to with ease. She is one of the mothers of the 11 new world [[Dragons|dragons]]. 
##### History
During a skirmish between [[Rauceveth]] and [[Kiagora]], Aurore is captured and enslaved by King [[Takemoto]]. He gifts her to his daughter, [[Princess Hozumi]], in an attempt to regain his daughters favor after losing it trying to conquer [[Rauceveth]]. 

[[Princess Hozumi]] takes pity on Aurore, not believing any of what happened to her to be right. She free's Aurore of her cuffs and though Aurore immediately uses her magic to threaten her life, Hozumi convinces her to cooperate, explaining that if Hozumi were to die, Aurores death would follow close behind. 

They plan Aurore's escape together, eventually secretly developing feelings for one another and not telling the other since eventually, Aurore would have to leave.  

One night, the palace was stormed and Aurore rushed to [[Princess Hozumi]] to protect her. She runs inter her mother, [[Morgane]], who reveals that she's come to bring her home. Morgane had slit [[Takemoto|King Takemoto's]] throat in his sleep and wanted to make sure [[Princess Hozumi]] met the same fate. 

Aurore refused and blasted her mother away in an attempt to rush and save Hozumi, but [[Morgane]] recovered quickly, cursing her daughter a traitor, casting spell after spell to slow her down or get her to fight back. Aurore ignored her mother despite the blows, determined to save [[Princess Hozumi|Hozumi]]. 

By the time she arrived, an assassin sent by her mother was hovering above her sleeping form, prepared to slit her throat. Aurore blasted the assassin off, but wasn't fast enough. Though the cut was sloppy, a cut was still made. 

Aurore rushed to [[Princess Hozumi|Hozumi's]] body, cradling her as she choked on her own blood. Aurore tried desperately to help her, but dark magic simply did not heal. Aurore begged for whatever divine being was out there to save [[Princess Hozumi]]. 

Through her injuries, [[Princess Hozumi]] confessed her love for Aurore, wishing for a world born anew where peace could truly be had. Perhaps then, she could have loved Aurore freely. 

As Aurore's tears begin to drop onto Hozumi, the wound begins to close. Aurore looks down at her hands and instead of casting a ball of darkness, its a soft floating moonlight above her hands. She placed the ball onto Hozumi's throat, watching as the would closed completely. 

Aurora kissed her beloved, and [[Princess Hozumi]] kissed back with a smile. 

The world shook. Aurore glowed with moonlignt, [[Princess Hozumi]] glowed with sunlight. The glows grew stronger by the second as the kiss deepened. 

The world was engulfed in light. When the light settled, the world had been born anew.
