The world used to be one landmass known as Phiclai, made up of two nations: [[Rauceveth]] and [[Kiagora]]. 

The nation of [[Rauceveth]] thrived in darkness—those blessed with the ability to cast magic bending the shadows and negative emotions to their will. 

The nation of [[Kiagora]] thrived in light—those blessed with the ability to cast magic bending the light and positive emotions to their will. 

After the [[World Origin#Aftermath|Aftermath]] of the world origin, [[Phiclai]] split into three—[[Braudrica]], [[Kjølik]], and [[Aukamen]]. 

All dark magic had evolved into magic of the moon, and all light magic had evolved into magic of the sun.
