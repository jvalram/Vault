### Physical 

EYES: RED
HAIR: GINGER
SKIN: A SLIGHT TAN

Yosi has an [[Yosi Wachter#^arcaneImplant|arcane implant]] located on her spine. The surgery was months before her CMR attendance, so its not noticeable aside from the surgery scar.  

Yosi is very fit as she is very disciplined with herself and her work. She hasn't visited the gym at CMR because she wants to scope out the entire campus before deciding how she wants to go about her days. 

Yosi is a very deep sleeper

Yosi likes soccer. She can play well, but prefers to watch and analyze. 
### Family and Backstory

**Mother**: mechanical engineer
**Father**: civil engineer

Yosi grew up in Erzeung's middle class with academic pressure from her parents being her only real stressor. Erzeung cities are where progress is fostered and promoted, so it's always been expected of her to become a progressive force and contribute to Erzeung's technological society. 

As a child, she wasn't prone to playing with toys in a normal way. Dolls didn't interest her and if there was a toy she could take apart, she would spend her free time learning to take it apart and then how to reconstruct it. Her parents rarely had to purchase new things, as little Yosi was easily entertained with the mechanics of her few toys and would find new ways to combine them and put them back together again. 

Yosi's father, Alfihar Wachter, was much stricter on Yosi. He felt there were enough mechanical engineers in Erzeung and that the true progress to be made lied within the cities infrastructure. He greatly disapproved of Yosi's interest in the mechanical field and was often cold towards his wife, feeling as though she influenced Yosi into the career path she chose. 

Yosi's mother, Ilma Wachter, was nearly equally as tough on her, though her and her husband saw that she was a little more merciful with her. They spent more time together on account of their shared interest and Yosi learned much of what she knows from her own mother. Ultimately, her relationship with her parents felt more like a business arrangement than anything loving, but this was something Yosi never minded. It honestly made more sense to her than having unconditional love in a traditional household. 

Both parents instilled a fear of uselessness in her. She's dedicated her life to being a worthwhile asset to the nation of Erzeung and it's heavily influenced her decision to attend CMR, with it being where Erzeung's Supreme General graduated from. Yosi regards the school and its faculty with respect solely because of their relation to the Supreme General. Those from outside the campus do not have her respect on account of being Penish. 

She had to be an A+ student and was often perceived by her peers back in Erzeung as 'mean' and 'self-absorbed'. Yosi has no idea they've perceived her this way. Described to Rel as "the worst cs major you've ever met"

Yosi spent most of her time pursuing her studies, not really making time to maintain friendships though very few had tried on account of her vile RBF. Her father encouraged her to at least get out of her room and learn her way around the city that he and his peers slaved away to maintain and improve. Yosi was never reluctant or disagreeable, she tends to obey authority without question.  

She would often study or work in coffee shops and bars and while she usually had laser sharp focus, the occasional older woman would walk in and grab her attention. 

Yosi lived a good life growing up and has never had to struggle in any capacity outside of said academic pressure. She is extremely privileged. 

In her head, she is permanently at an A- and will spend the rest of her life working to reach impossible perfection. 

At CMR, because of her circumstances, she presents a much 'kinder' version of herself. She holds her judgements to herself and thinks very little of those outside of the school (and for a few who do attend). Yosi can be a little cruel and was notorious amongst her Erzeunite peers for being abrasive and difficult to work with. 
##### Romantic Relationships
Yosi was notorious with the mothers of her city. It's very easy for her to become infatuated with them and has been a problem since they can all remember. It is definitely. a mommy issue. Yosi doesn't seem to realize she's visibly and obviously attracted to and pursuing these women, but they were all very very aware. 

She would often craft her latest infatuation handmade gifts and her recipients would think it was sweet at first, but Yosi is a little obvious so they all knew it was because she found them attractive.  She's handsome, so they don't mind very often but most are married so they tried not to encourage her. 

A few months before she left for CMR, one of the local single mothers gave her a chance. It was mostly out of pity, but part of her was charmed by Yosi's strange nature. She thought it could be an act of charity to indulge her before she was gone. 
##### Acceptance to CMR

- Yosi expresses an interest in studying at CMR
	- Yosi wants to study abroad to become a world class practitioner of creation magic. The maestro track seems to weigh on adventuring a lot more than the rest, so Yosi is in an awkward position. But she has no interest in entering an academic field. 
	- She wants to be skilled in usage, not understanding. 
- Yosi fills out a Life Plan that is then reviewed by the government
- The government does a full background check and determines that she's a suitable candidate for the spy program they have at CMR
- Yosi is then summoned to a government building where they commence a Life Plan interview with her and ask her if she *really* wants to go to CMR. 
- Yosi insists. 
- The government offers her the chance + a scholarship with the condition that she becomes a spy for the Erzeung government. 
- Yosi accepts. 
- Upon accepting, she's told her current protocol is to not draw suspicions and report all findings to her handler. 
### Interactions
**Yosi is very reserved**. She can be judgmental but is sure to stay nonconfrontational, especially considering her intentions here at CMR. 
##### General Interactions
- **Yosi thinks very highly of herself and her home.** 
	- Despite this pride, Yosi tries very hard not seem too narcissistic. Very rarely will she ever rate herself the highest score, but she also very rarely rates other the highest score. 
	- She's snobby with technology. She's not very happy about the makes and models of really anything at CMR. 
- **She will initially think less of others**, especially those native to Pensier, until they've proven themselves to her (or at least in her eyes). 
- **She won't voice her dislike of people if its based in subjective opinion and not an observed pattern of behaviors**, but she can be pushed into showing signs of annoyance. 
	- She's not one to lose her cool. She might have a temper hidden beneath her demeanor, but its not something that can come out easily. 
- **Yosi is blunt, but not necessarily cruel**. She believes that everyone at CMR has a reason to be there. 
	- **Do not confuse this behavior with compassion or kindness**. Its important to remember that these are objective facts to Yosi. There are not many people she genuinely cares for and she plans to keep it that way. 
	- She has her doubts on whether certain people *deserve* to be here, but believes that everyone is where they belong. 
- **Yosi prioritizes efficiency**. She wants as much done with as little waste and loss. Whatever profit margin she's aiming for has to hit its maximum or she'll be restless. 
	- This includes things like personal projects (the automaton that will be infinitely changed, tweaked, and improved upon but never completed) and the way that she communicates (using as few words as possible to get across as much meaning as possible)
		- This can make others see her as a bit awkward or mean. 
- **The trait she prioritizes the most in others is intelligence**. Brute strength is meaningless to her, but tact and strategy is impressive. 
- **She's unbothered by physical contact.** She's not affectionate by any means, but will not react positively or negatively. It'll be like she didn't even notice.
##### Personal Interactions

> With younger peers

Yosi isn't the nurturing type. The thing she's most likely to do when around someone younger is simply not address them or approach them. Someone like Niao'ha is the exception as she has proved herself a peer worthy of being acknowledged. 

> With peers her age

Yosi is the most judgmental with people within her age group. She holds everyone to the same standards she holds herself to and is very disappointed when they do not meet expectations. 

Yosi isn't prone to attachments. 

> With older 

Yosi is very respectful. She enjoys direction and wants to be told she's doing well by anyone with a hypothetical higher rank than her. This doesn't mean she's trusting of anyone who's her elder. She considers respect and trust very different fields. 

Yosi is a lot more nervous and fidgety around older women. She wants to be of service but she's also very prone to getting crushes on these older women who are completely out of her league. 

If a MILF tells her to sit, trust she will be sitting. 

> With Familiars

Yosi isn't really sure how she feels about them since they're not really a thing back in Erzeung. She doesn't see the appeal of having a familiar. She kind of feels like it just shows you're too weak to be your own witch. 

It confuses her that anyone would *choose* to have a servant that acts of its own volition and can be unpredictable instead of having an automaton that only does exactly what you want it to do. 

> With A.M.P.S.

Yosi has grown attached to her automaton, as silly as it seems. She has programmed him to mimic life and the actions of a typical dog. Partially for her own amusement, but also because she enjoys the company. 

If Yosi were to lose him or watch him be destroyed, it would be emotionally devastating despite the fact that she can just recreate him. He has no life or soul, but she's programmed him to mimic these things and thus left herself with a soft spot for him.
