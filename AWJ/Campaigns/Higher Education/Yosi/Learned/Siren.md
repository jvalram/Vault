Native to [[Shuǐeh]], they are carnivorous and only hungry for flesh of sentient beings.

Though they are native to Shuǐeh, they travel and can be found on coastlines. 
[[Mr. Cazal]] advises that you leave immediately if you hear any kind of music on coastlines

They have the ability to **Glamour** and perform **Sirens Call**
###### Glamour
- When beached they can glamour their appearance to mimic the appearance of any sentient being
- Can only do this for 24 hours
- Cannot reperform until they rest
###### Sirens Call

- Sirens call can hypnotize anyone who hears it. 
- Diaphragms allow them to project from 50 feet away

The ability is most commonly used to lure people into large bodies of water for easy pickings
###### Cursed Sirens
Cursed sirens were spawned into world's calamity devoid of reason, more dangerous than exorcized sirens.

Cursed state is more dangerous than exorcized state. 
Cursed state = dark magic, no ability to reason, pursuit of chaos and evil.
