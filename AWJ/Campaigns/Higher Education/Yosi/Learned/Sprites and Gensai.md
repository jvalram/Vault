> Learned from Sprites and Gensai book

1. Sprites are semi-aware beings made of purely condensed elemental magical energy. They typically manifest as small balls of light that tend to gather in places that contain highly concentrated amounts of elemental magical energy. Sprites do not seem to do much besides float in the air and send off short sparks of their own energy when touched. They are often collected and used in potions aimed at restoring magical energy. Gensai are sprites that have absorbed enough elemental magical energy from their surroundings to evolve into a fully sentient and intelligent being. Their bodies are still made of purely condensed elemental magical energy, leaving them to have somewhat of an incorporeal body. In order to better interact with the world, Gensai choose to wear clothes—particularly gloves and shoes—that allow them to grasp onto the tangible elements of the world. They are incapable of speech due to the nature of their bodies, oftentimes communicating through sign or writing. On their face, Gensai wear masks that are permanently affixed onto their faces. They cannot remove the masks, nor can anyone else. However, these masks can be shattered and broken through means of direct damage. If the mask is broken to the point of their faceless face being exposed, the Gensai will explode, their condensed elemental magical energy being dispersed back into the world. Beyond this method of death, Gensai are impervious to matters such as age or disease.

2. The term "Gensai" is an all encompassing one, as the term refers to an evolved sprite. However, depending on what type of magical energy the Gensai possesses, enough distinctions exist to classify Gensai into 11 different subspecies.

Oväder: Lightning Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their hands and feet, turning them into large clawed appendages that crackle with energy.

Genio: Mind Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their core, allowing them to cast an impeccable illusion. This allows them to appear as anything they please. The illusion is only broken if their mask is touched—being touched anywhere else does not break the illusion and feels exactly as that part should. They are also the only type of Gensai to have a voice through means of telepathy.

Chóma: Flora Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their arms and legs, the energy manifesting into actual plants to form tangible limbs that can easily be regrown if cut off or damaged.

Bōlàng: Water Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their backside, legs, and arms, the energy manifesting as fins that ripple when touched.

Dabka: Fire Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their backside and their head, making them appear as though they have hair and wings purely made of fire.

Erfinder: Creation Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed in their core, allowing them to manifest their energy at any point in their body into a creation. Such creations typically take the form of a technologically advanced prosthetic, but ultimately the limits of what they can create lie within their ability to create said creation organically.

Frostskader: Ice Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their head, manifesting as elegant and deadly horns made of solid ice.

Fırtına: Air Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their core, allowing them to take on a completely gaseous form at will, becoming completely intangible and immensely increasing their speed.

Piedra: Earth Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their arms and legs, the energy manifesting into actual bedrock that flexes smoothly at the Gensai's will.

Consacré: Moon Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their core, allowing their magical capabilities to spike under moonlight. At dawn, they become extremely fatigued, only being able to stay awake for an hour at most before falling into a deep hibernation state until dusk.

Mutafawiq: Sun Gensai. The energy of their body is highly condensed at their core, allowing their magical capabilities to spike under sunlight. At dusk, they become extremely fatigued, only being able to stay awake for an hour at most before falling into a deep hibernation state until dawn.
