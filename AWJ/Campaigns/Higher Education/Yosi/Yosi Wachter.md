Early Day 8
> 12/19/2024

- Lis and Winnifred didn't wake up early.

	- Yosi tells him that A.M.P.S. doesn't feel fear, but that he is worried about the two. She leaves A.M.P.S. with him as she gets ready for the day.

- The meal isn't too eventful. They wave at the other students they see. 
- During breakfast, it's revealed that Lis and Winnifred were struck down trying to rush a job, probably explaining why they slept in and went to sleep in such a bad state. 
- They arrange to go pick a MAL mission together after their next class. 
- They all go to class at [[Ms. Romero]]
	- They're asked to arrange their chairs into a circle and each share a secret, because secrets aren't good for strengthening a team. 
		- [[Patrick Seif|Trick]]: "My real name is Patrick"
		- Yosi: "My real name is Yosefine"
		- [[Eliott-Mael]]: "uh i guess mines is that i did the hw before we actually hung out w each other...so some of you are rated weird"

		- [[Tony]]: "I like the food back home more, but I didn't want to say anything."
- They pick a team leader for the class and though the majority of the team
	- The team initially wants to make [[Niao'ha]] the leader, but Yosi interrupts (especially upon seeing that Niao'ha was uncomfortable) and says they should vote for someone else and let Niao'ha focus on performing as well as she has been
	- Lis disagrees with her, saying that Niao'ha has the team to support her and that she'll be fine. Yosi stresses that she doesn't need this kind of pressure just because no one else on the team wants to take up the title. 
	- Eventually the majority settles on Tony, but familiars can't be leaders so Trick ends up being group leader. 
- Trick is handed the papers for the homework [[Ms. Romero]] assigned them. [[Alessio]] asks why he has them and Trick says he guesses she gave them to him because he's technically captain. Alessio falls to the floor in despair. 
	- Lis turns to [[Eliott-Mael]] and tells him to inform his familiar that its both of their faults he was even elected. 
	- This upsets Eliott and he comments that he might've rated Lis too high. Then for her to tell Alessio herself. 
	- Lis reveals that she isn't interested in interacting with the familiar of another witch and it sets Eliott off. 
	- Yosi tries to interrupt them, reminding them to think of how a public argument would reflect onto their team.  Trick butts in and tries to reason with the two, stating that familiars are a part of the team and it would be a good to get along
	- Lis says that her feelings for familiars have always been the same. She doesn't find it surprising that she would want to speak with the greater species to relay information to their familiar. 
	- Eliott calls her a bitch and tells her that if she doesn't watch her mouth, she might die in her sleep. Lis insults him and tells him to threaten her when he can withstand a fight longer than 5 minutes. 
	- Yosi butts back in, telling Eliott that he doesn't need to use that kind of language and is getting too worked up over this. This turns Eliott against Yosi. 
	- Alessio tries to calm Eliott and Trick eventually butts in, saying this might just be a bit of a culture class and that the team should drop it. Eliott comments that perhaps Trick was the right choice for captain after all. 
	- Lis also stares at him with interest. Yosi assumes this is because she might be starting to agree. Niao'ha eventually comments that she thinks he'll do great. 
- There will be a ball, Friday 8PM at the Special Affairs building.
- The group goes to the MAL building to pick an assignment
- Lis suggests the ARR 3 gumiho mission, but then says maybe they should do an ARR 1 since a lot of the team is still AR 1. The team says they can do the ARR3 against Lis's suggestion. They're informed that they have one week to complete the mission and they must bring back proof.

	- [[Alejandra Lismarie Avilas|Lis]] stands up, clutching her head, and tells the others she's heading to the nurse's office. Trick tells her that maybe food and water would help her feel better, causing Eliott to perk up again and ignore the situation in favor of getting some food in his stomach.

		- [[Mx. Ravilla]] accidentally lets out a laugh while the other faculty sympathetically wince.

	- Yosi scans out of curiosity and is taken to a site where she can put her name and ID down to reserve a timeslot for auditions, along with a series of links leading to provided monologues from the play for her to practice then audition with. 
		- **Princess Danbi**:
			"To begin today's meeting, I have reconvened with my advisors as we discussed the matter of the neutral free zone. Based on the rejections of the previously proposed northwest border of Pensier, we would instead like to formally show an interest in creating a neutral zone in the central west border of Pensier. As I and my advisors understand it, although this border contains quite the number of your people, it lacks the mines you seem to covet so much. Instead, it appears to be used as agricultural land? With this proposal, we will neutralize this area, your own people getting a month's warning before it's happening. You will still have access to the agricultural lands. However, given the new neutrality zone, I cannot personally guarantee the safety of any who enter. What say you, Prince Yoshinaga?"
		- **Prince Yoshinaga Hayato**:
			“I almost resorted to buying you to get you back. I would’ve put the kingdom in financial ruins, and treated you like a business exchange. And then to make me feel better my parents thought it right to fetch me a new guard who, I’m sure, is only trying to test and see if the rumors are true. That I bed my Guards, but I don’t. I never bed you, but I did give you my heart."
		- **Natanaël Bassot**:
			"Soon, you will have no need for such a daydream. We will have that reality, my love. Being able to walk through gardens with you at any time of day, just the two of us. And maybe her too. I cannot thank you enough for your part in bringing us all together, Yoshi. My baobei, my Prince, my King." 
		- **Mediator Gagnon**:
			"At this point, I would like to be able to return home in a timely manner. Concede the northeast border of your kingdom as a neutral hunting ground to the Kingdom of Pensier. It's a land with a relatively low population, people out on the fringes of your civilization, as I understand. Princess Danbi calls it an acceptable margin of loss in comparison to imposing on your more heavily populated central east border or your southeast border. Should you accept that proposal of hers, I'm certain negotiations will finally come to a close, and with a bit of expediting on my end, we should all be free to return home within a month—all the time I'll need to give you what you desire."
	- Yosi has a lot of time leftover in her days. It's not something she's really interested in, but there's not much else for her to do. 
- She considers auditioning until she spots [[Patrick Seif|Trick]] leaving the auditorium. She manages to catch him by calling out his name.
	- Yosi asks him is he's planning on auditioning. He says it seemed like something he'd like. He then asks if he'll see her at auditions. 
	- Yosi tells him she isn't sure yet, but knowing there'll be a familiar face there she was considering it. 
	- Trick says he's not planning on practicing or picking a part, he'll just guess when he gets there. He then tells Yosi he didn't think she'd be into plays, which Yosi tells him is correct. She just doesn't have much to do.
	- She asks Trick for tips and he tells her about the code to scan and that acting is just like playing house, to which Yosi admits she was never one for playing house. (YOSI DOESN'T PLAY.)
	- Trick offers to practice together once they get back into their dorms and pretend to argue over a mortgage or something. 
		- Yosi very. very. reluctantly agrees.

###### Day 1 — MON
**Late Day 1**
>11/19/2024 [SOLO SESSION]

	- There's tea tables and chairs - nice for dates.
	- Yosi inspects a shovel, adding the tool to her arsenal. 
- Automatons are only really cool within Erzeung, but Shuian's and Raji's might think it's cool. The Penish will probably have more of a problem with it. 
- Admissions to CMR from Erzeunites are very limited. It's likely that she's one of the very few Erzeunites at this school. 
- Yosi could summon another [[A.M.P.S.]] if anything were to happen to his vessel. 
- Curfew at CMR is 10pm
- One [[A.M.P.S.]] mod per solo session
	- Modding [[A.M.P.S.]] takes half a day (9 hours)
- Puppets can be bought or made, and must be made of non-living inorganic matter (until a certain level.)
- Other nations are naturally suspicious of the Penish on account of their use of mind magic.
	- The Penish also hate Erzeung for being an authoritarian dictatorship with imperialist goals
- Erzeung intentionally sent Yosi with very little information in case she came across a Mind magic user here on Pensier, though most well mannered Penish people don't peek into peoples minds.
