Siren/Nymph | 5'2" | she/her | 14 | [[Maestro]]

![[Niao'ha.webp | 180]]

**Magic**: Water
**Nation**: [[Shuǐeh]]
**Personality**: A bit nervous, but otherwise very kind. 
**Weakness**: She claims it's her low strength and close quarter combat. She's also very weak without her halberd. 
**Reason for attending**: She wants to learn as much as she can and be more prepared to help her mothers in any situation. 

Niao'ha lives in a separate dorm with someone named [[Miss Faleria Benetti]], who the team has not met yet. 

[[Yosi Wachter]] thinks very highly of Niao'ha, believing her to be the most capable of her team. An extremely impressive feat considering her age and Yosi's standards. 

Yosi makes an effort to try and show kindness towards Niao'ha. She respects her and imagines it isn't very pleasant being the odd one out. 

###### NOTES: 

>11/21/2024

- Niao'ha reveals to [[Alejandra Lismarie Avilas]] that she's an only child to her mothers (whether there's more than 2 is unknown to Yosi...)
- Niao'ha mentions Miss Faleria again when Lis asks how she feels about staying alone. 

> 11/15/2024

- Niao'ha is very nervous about being here. She's very young, so she might be looking for approval and worried about fitting in. She's the odd one out in the group solely on account of her young age.
- Niao'ha is the most durable member of the team. She has healing abilities, good offensive magic, and the most HP out of the group. 
- When Niao'ha mentions her low strength, [[Alejandra Lismarie Avilas]] tells her that she can be her defense using her earth magic. 
- [[Alessio]] is protective of her, not trusting his teammates to be kind or gentle with her. 
- She's exceptionally kind as well, thanking an enemy team that had insulted her own teammates. Yosi understands she only wants to be liked and doesn't question her loyalty. 
- Yosi has allowed Niao'ha to come to the dorm for dinner.
