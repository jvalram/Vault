Witch | height unknown | he/they | unknown age | [[Maestro]]

![[Elliot.webp | 250]]
Familiar: [[Alessio]]
Magic: Ice/Moon
Nation: [[A'lune]]

Room 1: 1a - [[Patrick Seif]] & [[Tony]] | | 1b - Eliott-Mael & [[Alessio]]

Yosi isn't really able to pin down what kind of person Elliot is. He seems kind, but not certain of himself. He's self conscious about his right to be here. 

Reason for attending: CMR is his dream school, he's always wanted to come. 

###### NOTES: 

>11/21/2024

- Elliot is also not fond of [[Patrick Seif]]
- [[Tony]] is upset with Elliot for calling him a tiger. 
- Elliot does not think he deserves to be here. Yosi reassured him that he's here because he belongs here, but she's taken note of his insecurity as one of his weaknesses. 

> 11/15/2024

- [[Yosi Wachter]] was unimpressed with Elliot-Mael's performance during the mock battle. She hasn't taken note of many of his other traits. 
- Elliot seems close with his familiar. A'lune does see familiars as platonic soulmates, so it might not be romantic. 
- Elliot and [[Tony]] talk briefly about Alessio and how it must be a lot for Elliot to handle. Elliot doesn't seem to mind it so much. 
- Elliot casts frost zone a little too close to [[Alejandra Lismarie Avilas]], pissing her off severely. He swears he'll make it up to her. 
- Elliot does seem to have something of a temper, telling the members of the opposite team to "kill yourself bitch"
