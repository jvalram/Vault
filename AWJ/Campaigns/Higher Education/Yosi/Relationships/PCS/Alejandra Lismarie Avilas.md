- Yosi will reveal that she just got registered in Pensier but plans to transfer out early to be registered in Erzeung by the time she gets back.
- Lis reveals that she ran out of Nova today. She was asked to get materials for her first aid class and she failed to realize how expensive those materials were. She then said she didn't feel comfortable heading out into the forest of Pensier just yet. 
- Yosi asks what materials she needs and Lis lists some organic materials like fucking slime or something and reiterates that she wasn't confident in heading out into the forest with just 2 people.
	- Yosi says "Two people?" and Lis reveals that the other person is [[Hallkatla Af'Skog]]. Yosi will tense up.

	- Yosi asks how nova much Lis needs
	- Lis and [[Hallkatla Af'Skog]] are planning on going out on MAL jobs to make back what she's lost. 
		- Yosi tells Lis that if she ever needs an extra hand, she's always available
		- Lis tells Yosi that she's helped plenty, with getting [[Winnifred]] to open up and be more confident. 
		- Lis says she wishes they could exchange and Yosi lifts Amps up by his squiddle arms and looks at him before handing him to Lis. So she can hold him by his squiddle arms. 
			- Lis looked at him with wide-eyed wonder before making him do the dingadading dance. She didn't make the sounds (MAX NOTE: she did in her mind.)
- Yosi tells Lis that there's a chance [[A.M.P.S.]] is forged of [[Terra]]n metal, then asks Lis what Terra is like. 
	- Lis says its hot, dry, and every man for himself. If you're not an adventurer then what are you? If you can't fight, tough luck. 
	- Yosi asks why she would ever want to go back. Lis says its home and she hasn't really liked anywhere else. 
	- Yosi asks where she's been and Lis rolls her eyes and says [[A'lune]], [[Pensier]], and [[Klorída]]
	- Lis asks where Yosi's visited and Yosi awkwardly says this is her first time outside of Erzeung. 
	- Lis says she would've recommended Terra but its not really first-time adventurer friendly. Yosi will chuckle at this and say "I guess you're right."
- Winnifred walks in and is worried about whether A.M.P.S. getting hurt and Yosi assures him that he isn't programmed to feel pain. He asks to hold A.M.P.S. and Lis hands him over but forces Winnifred to hold him from his little legs. 
	- Winnifred is scared but Yosi points out that A.M.P.S. 's tail is wagging harder, so he must be happy to see him. 
- Lis leaves to shower and Yosi takes care of rearranging their beds for the night. 
	- Lis walks out and asks if this is going to be an every night thing? and Yosi responds if its alright with her. 

NIGHT 4
> 12/1/2024

- In her sleep, Yosi turns and wraps her arms around [[Winnifred]]. Winnifred lets out a loud yelp, waking up Lis. Yosi will remain deeply asleep. 
- Winnifred will continue yelping and Lis will get up to see what all the commotion is and in the process, trips over Yosi sleeping body at the foot of her bed and toppling onto both of them. 
- Lis is not happy about touching Winnifred. 
- Lis covers Winnifred's mouth as they see Yosi start to murmur awake. She tells him she needs him to shut up and that she's trying to get them out of this mess. 
- Winnifred is more scared of touching Lis than he is of waking Yosi. 
- Yosi mumbles out "A.M.P.S. you can't eat chocolate, you're a dog..." and wraps her arms around whatever's closest to her, Lis and Winnifred. 
- Lis still has her mouth over Winnifred's mouth as he screams into it. Now she's touching both Yosi and Winnifred and is. even closer to Winnie. Neither of them get much sleep that night. 
- They get up to start their day before Yosi does, so she never notices. 
- Yosi gets a good nights rest.

- Yosi didn't like how Lis was kind to [[Hallkatla Af'Skog]] despite her hostility towards their teammates. She thought Lis was more loyal and more difficult to impress than just speaking bluntly. 
- Lis took a familiar relations class to improve(?) her relationship with [[Winnifred]]. This class is also where she met [[Aten Nizam]]
- Yosi overheard Lis talking to Niao'ha about her family. Two sisters, 15 and 23.

Late Day 3 ^de8d84
>11/28/2024 [OOC]

- [[Yosi Wachter]] and Lis go over [[Ms. Romero]]'s out of battle assignment once they're back in their rooms together.
	- **Lis's Rankings**
		- Elliot: 3 – conversationalist and an enthusiast for team engagement. perhaps talks far too much without notable action.
		- Trick: 3 – easy going and approachable. perhaps a bit too easygoing and a bit airheaded.
		- Niao'ha: 5 – sweet and receptive to others. a bit young, but she outranks us all thus far
		- Yosi: 4 – effective communicator and enjoyable to be around. a bit reserved, yet that is in no means a negative
		- Lis: 3 – i do not know my strengths, but i am amicable to what the group wants. i could be more approachable to my team.
	- Lis criticizes her rankings and Yosi adjusts accordingly. 
	- Yosi tells Lis and she has [[Patrick Seif]] ranked too highly and Lis explains that though she doesn't like Trick at all, she see's that he is well liked and sociable and for that she's ranked him as high as she has. 
- Yosi learns that Lis spent some time in a study room at the library with [[Aten Nizam]]
	- Lis and Aten have met before CMR. 
	- Yosi tells Lis she has a class with them and this makes Lis really happy. Anyone who has any kind of connection to Aten is seen more highly to Lis. 
	- Lis says she didn't know Yosi and Aten shared a mindset. Yosi asks what Lis means with this and for a moment Lis struggles to find the right words to describe it. 
	- She eventually falls on that anyone taking a class like POL here at CMR is intelligent in the same way and she really respects that about Aten and in turn, respects that about Yosi. 
- Yosi see's that [[Hallkatla Af'Skog]] has also been messaging Lis. 
	- Lis befriended her at the Gym. 
- The third name on her recently texted list is someone named [[Angel]]
	- Angel is taking an earth magic class with Lis. Angel is close with [[Aten Nizam]]. 
- Lis offers to introduce Yosi to Aten and Yosi accepts. 
- Yosi and Lis go over their assignment, discuss their opinions on [[Eliott-Mael]] and [[Alessio]], as well as [[Patrick Seif]]. They bond over this. 
	- Lis doesn't like Elliot for the same reason Yosi doesn't like Hallkatla. They have little control over their emotions. Lis also doesn't like the close relationship Elliot and Allessio have. 
	- Yosi mentions she doesn't really hold what Elliot and Allessio say in very high regard, getting a giggle out of Lis. This surprises Yosi as she's never heard her laugh before. 
- After talking about Elliot and Alessio's interesting relationship, Yosi tells Lis that she doesn't really see the point in all of it and Lis explains the why to her. 
	- Lis tells about how some witches need familiars as magical boosters 
	- Yosi tells Lis she performed exceptionally without hers, so she still doesn't see the point in having one if you're a perfectly competent witch without them. 
	- Lis really appreciates being told that she's a powerful witch without her familiar. She also doesn't think she needs [[Winnifred]] to be a powerful witch. 
- Yosi asks Lis if she would ever want an automaton like [[A.M.P.S.]] and Lis says that it just isn't possible to maintain them back in [[Terra]]. Yosi then asks why she doesn't move to Erzeung and after a long pause Lis jokes back that she hates her family, but not that much. 
- Lis leaves to get ready for bed (approx. 15 min) and within that time, Yosi convinces Winnifred to rearrange their beds on the ground so they can both fit. Yosi sleeps on the side closest to Lis and [[Winnifred]] sleeps next to where Yosi's old bed was with [[A.M.P.S.]] in his arms.
- Lis walks out of the bathroom and is unsure of how to react to her room being rearranged in. such a short amount of time. She asks how she'll get to her bed without stepping on Yosi and Yosi, in all seriousness, responds with telling Lis that she can take it.
