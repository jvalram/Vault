###### NOTES: 

>11/21/2024 [CAMPAIGN]

- Allesio holds Elliot's hand a lot. They might have some kind of romantic relationship. 

> 11/15/2024 [CAMPAIGN]

- Alessio is more loose-lipped than his witch, often times getting him just as riled up.
- Alessio asked that the keys be given to him instead of Elliot. Strange behavior for a familiar, at least as far as Yosi knows. 
- Alessio doesn't want [[Patrick Seif]] to get close to Elliot, seeming a little possessive. 
- Alessio is especially kind towards [[Niao'ha]], welcoming her into the room while Yosi and Lis were busy with A.M.P.S.
	- He wants to take care of her, not trusting the rest of his team to be gentle enough. 
- Alessio tries to ask someone in the auditorium about that's going on. That person ends up being [[Hallkatla Af'Skog]], who then angrily asks him where his witch is at. Alessio despises her now. 
	- Alessio asks the person behind them if he's a cunt too. This person is [[Hyunshik Inoyue]]. This upsets Hyunshik.
- Alessio is a lot more confrontational than Elliot. Yosi doesn't mind, as in his case its a little deserved and justified considering he was just insulted.
