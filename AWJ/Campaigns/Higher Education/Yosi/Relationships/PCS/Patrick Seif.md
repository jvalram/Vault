Reason for attending: "Looking for someone. Polishing my skills is a nice bonus." - presumed to be in a romantic sense. Now confirmed to NOT be in a romantic sense. 
###### **NOTES**: 

###### DAY 5
Early Day 5
> 12/4/2024

- Patrick officially states that he's auditioning for the part of The Prince
- Trick has a staring contest with Lis where he uses mind magic and impacts her so greatly she has to make a visit to the clinic. 

###### DAY 4
> 12/4/2021 [SOLO]

- [[Yosi Wachter]] spots [[Patrick Seif|Trick]] leaving the auditorium. She manages to catch him by calling out his name.
	- Yosi asks him is he's planning on auditioning. He says it seemed like something he'd like. He then asks if he'll see her at auditions. 
	- Yosi tells him she isn't sure yet, but knowing there'll be a familiar face there she was considering it. 
	- Trick says he's not planning on practicing or picking a part, he'll just guess when he gets there. He then tells Yosi he didn't think she'd be into plays, which Yosi tells him is correct. She just doesn't have much to do.
	- She asks Trick for tips and he tells her about the code to scan and that acting is just like playing house, to which Yosi admits she was never one for playing house. (YOSI DOESN'T PLAY.)
	- Trick offers to practice together once they get back into their dorms and pretend to argue over a mortgage or something. 
		- Yosi very. very. reluctantly agrees. 
###### Day 3
Early Day 3 
>11/21/2024 [CAMPAIGN]

- Trick is surprisingly studious. He supposedly spent the whole night studying. 
- During lunch, Trick chose to sit with the rival team from their mock battle ([[Hallkatla Af'Skog]], [[Walaa Hajjar]], [[Tanaydin Saglik]], [[Nofri]], [[Deepak Vemulapalli]]) instead of his own team. This has made Yosi dislike him a lot more than she initially did. 
- Trick tries to flirt with [[Hyunshik Inoyue]] and fails miserably, as Hyunshik spots Alessio who he's had problems with previously. 
- He's taking a mind and ritual casting class. 

###### Day 1
Early Day 1
> 11/15/2024

- Yosi isn't very fond of Trick. 
- Trick comes from the circus. 
- Very informal.
- Narcissistic and over-confident. Sits in the front so everyone can see his jawline. 
- Trick fights using a deck of cards. Yosi isn't really sure quite how that works. 
- Performed poorly during the mock battle. He spent a lot of it running away, but did manage to throw a few of their enemies.

###### **RELATIONSHIPS**: 
**Family**: Trick has a sister who he used to send silly images telepathically to and an aunt who taught him how to do it on a smaller scale.
