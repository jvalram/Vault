- Mr. Cazal is an experienced [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Vampire|Vampire]] and [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Gumiho|Gumiho]] hunter. 
-  During class, he discusses how [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Gumiho|Gumihos]], [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Siren|Sirens]], [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Vampire|Vampires]] are the recognized monsters
	- In the past, werewolves were also considered to be monsters but had their positioning on the list reversed after negotiations about not belonging on the monster list. This happened around 100 years ago and the memories of the people and ageless people consider it very recent
	- Vampires are also ageless
	- Demons can spawn everywhere and are arguably the most dangerous kind of monster
		- Unholy creatures, harbingers of chaos and immorality gifted in dark magic
		- they can also perform subtypes of magic
		- they're incapable of doing anything that isnt evil
		- they are impervious to age and disease
		- the only way they can die is if they're killed. 
	- Vampires are native to A'lune, but can technically be anywhere int he world. He's personally seen some in Pensier but its very rare. They are a big problem in A'lune. 
	- there ARE TWO VARIANTS
	- LEGACY
		- subgroups: born as vampires, spawned into existence as part of worlds calamity, and original legacy vampires devoid of reason and skilled in dark magic
		- Avoid them at all cause and they are unique to other monsters as they've regained reasoning capabilities that caused them to create covens and become highly organized and dangerous
		- Even non cursed vampires are dangerous no account of their diet. 
		- There are a lot of misinformation that surrounds vampires, but the teacher assures them he will clear it up
	- SIRE
		- Created from drinking the blood of a vampire
		- Its fine to drink blood from a sire vampire however, but there are no benefits. 
		- most species can become spire vampires but nymphs, (other ones i forgot) and a few more are immune. 
		- They can be dispatched via exorcism or just killed
- [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Siren|See for notes on: Sirens]]
- GUMIHOS
	- Says around the same things as Mr. Appel. Talks about how they glamour to appear as kitsune. also come in cursed and exorcized states. 
	- Powerful and manipulative because of mind magic
		- illusions for luring
		- manipulation for weakening
	- Says never to go into the forest without proper supervision of someone who is able to kill a gumiho. 
	- THIS WEEKS HW: going to a guild and finding and bringing back a posting that you think your team can handle
