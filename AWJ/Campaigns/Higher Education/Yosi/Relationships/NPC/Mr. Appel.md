- First day of Adventuring and Success class
- Went over species who are harmful
- [[Wishmaker]] - brought up by Mr. Appel who believes in their existence. He insists that this room is vetted by him and safe against Wishmakers
	- Yosi asks why this room is safe and its because nothing in the room is one solid color, making it impossible for a Wishmaker to camouflage. 
	- He mentions that its bad to talk about them outside of this class because they could be listening
	- Triggered by the key words "I wish"
- Warned against [[Campaigns/Higher Education/Yosi/Learned/Gumiho|Gumiho]]'s who are native to Pensier and are known to hunt on CMR grounds. 
	- Kitsunes look very similar to Gumihos but if you see a Kitsune with MORE than one tail, its a Gumiho. 
	- If you see a Gumiho, do your best to escape and let faculty know. 
	- Gumihos are shapeshifters and have some mind magic abilities.
