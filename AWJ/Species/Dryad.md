Native to [[Klorída]], dryads are mystical and powerful beings. 

They appear loosely humanoid in shape but are often made up of nature—such as having moss for hair and patches of moss growing on their green skin or twigs growing out of their back. 

They have the unique ability to transform into whatever nature they are made out of—an oak tree dryad being able to turn into a solid living tree and back. 

They have an affinity for #flora magic.

#### Half Dryads
Half dryads receive elements of the nature their dryad parent is a part of, but it is not all consuming of their body—simply patches of it, markings, or hair difference. They too have the unique ability to transform into their respective nature and back.
