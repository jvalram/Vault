If a soul dies with "too much" regret/unfinished business, that soul will linger on Mulvao as a [[Ghost]] instead of returning to the reincarnation flow immediately.

The longer the ghost is on Mulvao, the odds of it mutating/evolving into a wraith/[[Specter]] increase.

As a wraith, ghosts will grow to look more monstrous and grotesque. 

Wraiths (and Specters) are essentially stronger versions of ghosts, with Wraiths gaining the ability to use #dark magic. 

Ghosts, Specters, and Wraiths are all immortal-ish. At the source, all three can be dealt with by fulfilling their regret/unfinished business, allowing their souls to move on into the reincarnation flow. 

Ghosts/Specters go to [[Velesteus]].

Wraiths go to the void, never to be reincarnated again unless [[Asmotheus]] was particularly impressed with the Wraith. 

Wraiths are the second most common of the three Ghost related species.
