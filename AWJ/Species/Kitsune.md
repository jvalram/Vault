Native to Pensier, Kitsunes are powerful magical creatures that hold an affinity for #mind magic. 

They appear humanlike in appearance with the exception of fox ears, a single fox tail, sharper canines, claw-like nails, and vertically slit pupils. 

Kitsunes age until a point of full maturity at which point the aging process ceases for eternity.

**Kitsunes possess the ability to both transform and glamour**. Every kitsune is able to transform into a fox at will for an unlimited amount of time. They are also able to glamour themselves to both appear and physically mimic the appearance of any sentient being for as long as they please. However, being physically hurt past a certain threshold will dispel the glamour.

**Kitsunes are uniquely able to imitate a set rotation of spells from other magical types provided they've seen the spell before**. The amount of spells in rotation is relative to the kitsune's magical prowess and each spell must be sufficiently practiced before use.

There are two known variants of kitsunes: **Born** and **Enlightened**.

#### Born Kitsunes

Born kitsunes are kitsunes who were born as such. 

These kitsunes can most commonly be found in their own villages deep in the forests, but several choose to participate as active members of grander society.

#### Enlightened Kitsune

Enlightened kitsune are exorcised gumiho who successfully went through the process known as "[[Enlightenment]]", thus transforming them into a kitsune. 

The specifics of Enlightenment vary from source to source, but it is generally agreed that Enlightenment occurs when an exorcised gumiho has a genuine change of heart. 

Upon becoming Enlightened, kitsunes are said to receive the blessing "[[Knowledge of Scholar Vasco]]".
