# Specter

If a soul dies with "too much" regret/unfinished business, that soul will linger on Mulvao as a Ghost instead of returning to the reincarnation flow immediately.

The longer the ghost is on Mulvao, the odds of it mutating/evolving into a [[Wraith]]/[[Specter]] increase.

As Specters, their appearance remains the same as a [[Ghost]], but more clear. 

Wraiths (and Specters) are essentially stronger versions of ghosts, with Wraiths gaining the ability to use dark magic. 

Ghosts, Specters, and Wraiths are all immortal-ish. At the source, all three can be dealt with by fulfilling their regret/unfinished business, allowing their souls to move on into the reincarnation flow. 

Ghosts/Specters go to [[Velesteus]].

Wraiths go to the void, never to be reincarnated again unless [[Asmotheus]] was particularly impressed with the Wraith. 

## Abilities

Specters can make themselves visible/communicate to anyone they want, but becoming visible to the mortal eye takes up energy so its limited. 
## Weaknesses

- Curses that will turn them into [[Wraith|Wraiths]]
- Dark magic
- Certain rituals
