Closely associated with [[Sesur-sati]], as the peaqui (along with [[Pharaoh Pashet|Pashet]], the [[Arunshoa]], and the [[Anunoth]]) guided the people and allowed them to storm and slay Sesur-sati, putting his tyrannical reign to an end.  

As Sesur-sati's corpse shattered into a flux of magical sun energy, the Peaqui, [[Anunoth]], and [[Arunshoa]] took some of the free energy and blessed Pashet.
