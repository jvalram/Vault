Native to [[Nations/Mulvao/Aukamen/Raj/Raj|Raj]], saneals (sand seals?) are powerful and magical creatures that are both human and seal. 

They have a strong, deep connection to the earth. A connection that runs so deep that saneals have been noted to have an aversion to water, preferring dirt baths to keep themselves clean. 

Asocial by nature, saneals have a reputation for being elusive in society. From what has been observed of saneals, pods or groups of them are rare, saneals preferring a solitary existence. Despite this, saneals are not entirely absent from general society. 

However, they tend to keep to themselves and seldom let on about their true nature as saneals. They can take their saneal skin on and off as frequently as they like, but must refresh their magic through their daily diet of mineral rocks. 

While in human form, saneals retain all of their magical abilities alongside an enhanced stamina, strength, grit, the capacity to speak the saneal tongue, and the ability to see clearly through any abrasively blinding conditions (such as blizzards, sandstorms, etc.). They are oftentimes larger in size compared to [[Selkie|selkies]].

#### Saneal Skin

Saneal skin is also special in that it has the ability to tangibly glamour any who partially don it into a witch. A [[Velekin]] who wears the skin would appear and feel fully like a witch. A dryad who wore the skin would look and feel entirely like a witch, not a hint of a twig on their person. 

Additionally, wearing the skin also grants the wearer the ability to use earth magic if the ability does not already exist in the wearer. If the ability does exist in the wearer already, then the saneal skin serves as an additional source of magic, allowing the wearer to transcend their limits. 

When the saneal skin is completely slipped into, those who wear it enter the form of a seal, just like a true saneal. 

In order for all of these boons to work, the saneal skin must be in a refreshed state from a continued upkeep of the mineral rock diet while the skin is being worn. If the saneal skin wears out from not being refreshed, the saneal skin will lose all of its magic until it is appropriately refreshed by a mass consumption of mineral rocks. 

#### Half Saneals

Half saneals are essentially equal to a saneal's human form, retaining all the same boons. 

They can also transform into a seal for a limited amount of time without worry of a seal skin. However, at minimum, this transformation will only last 1 hour (and 8 hrs at max) before the half saneal forcibly reverts and requires a long rest before being able to transform again.
