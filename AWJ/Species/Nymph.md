Lifespan: [[Ageless]]
Location: #shuieh 

Native to [[Shuǐeh]], nymphs are mystical and powerful beings. 

They appear loosely humanoid in shape but are made entirely out of liquid. They have the unique ability to shift through all three stages of liquid—gas, solid, liquid. 

They can control this ability as they please. Although nymphs are unable to speak, they possess a unique form of one-way telepathy that allows them to share their emotions to any being. 

They have an affinity for #water magic. 

#### Half Nymphs

Half nymphs appear completely human in appearance save for a single aspect of themselves being composed of liquid (arm, leg, hair, a piece of torso, etc.), but obtain the unique ability to liquify themselves. 

However, they cannot phase through the different stages of liquid like their nymph parent can.
