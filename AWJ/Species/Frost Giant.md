Native to [[Kjølik]], frost giants are extremely large in size—typically ranging anywhere from 15-17 feet. 

Their skin is typically a blueish hue, but they otherwise appear human in appearance. They are incredibly powerful—both physically and magically. 

They live in clans and tend to not associate with human society, often keeping to themselves in uninhabited areas. They have an affinity for #ice magic.
