Asmokin are humanoids known for their unique appearanceâ€”red/orange/pink/yellow skin, hair of any color, eyes of a single color with no visible pupil or iris, finned, flared out ears, horns, sharp fanged teeth, and a long tail ending in fins. 

They are commonly believed to be created in the image of the Chaosbringer, [[Asmotheus]]. 

Contrary to this belief, asmokin do not appear to be naturally inclined towards chaos and are unique and varied individuals with their own personalities. 

They are native to [[Braudrica]] as a whole and have an affinity for #fire, #lightning, #earth, and #ice magic.
