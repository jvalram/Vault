Native everywhere, Contrai appear as human-like in appearance but much shorter, averaging about 3'-4' in height. 

Like elves, their ears are long/normal length and pointed. They are similar to humans in that magic for Contrai works the same way it does for witches. However, Contrai are incapable of having familiars. 

In their **Betrayed** form, their skin turns coal black as their body becomes grotesquely corded in muscle and grows to be about 6'-7' in height. Their hands and feet become clawed as their bodies crackle with the only type of magic this form has an affinity forâ€”dark magic.

#### Contractual Binding

Contrai are infamous for their unique contractual binding. Whenever a deal or contract is made with a Contrae , the Contrae will do whatever it takes to complete their end of the bargain, leading to their reputation of being incredibly **reliable** and **trustworthy**. 

If a Contrae were to ever fail their end of the bargain, the passive magic that allows them to turn into a **Betrayed** turns on themselves, instantly killing the Contrae if they fail to complete their end of the deal within the time allotted by the deal/contract. 

However, if the other party fails to hold up their end of the bargain within the deadlines set in the deal/contract, the Contrae involuntarily transforms into a twisted, monstrous version of themselves. This form is typically referred to as "**Betrayed**". 

#### Betrayed Form

In their **Betrayed** form, Contrai lose all sense and reason, only having a single minded directive to avenge themselves of their betrayal. 

The only way the Contrae can return back to their regular form is by exacting justice on those who have broken the deal/contract. This "justice" typically ends in a gruesome death for the person who dared to break a deal/contract with a Contrae. 

Generally, it is highly recommended of anyone who spots a Betrayed to simply leave them alone and steer clear of their path. Although incredibly dangerous and hostile to their target, Betrayed do not interact or harm anyone who isn't their target. 

However, they have been known to attack someone who isn't their target if provoked enough. For this, Contrai are just as equally feared as they are respected.
