Native to [[Shuǐeh]], Mermaids are powerful magical creatures that hold an affinity for #water magic. They are easily distinguishable by their aquatic appearance. 

They possess the upper body of a humanoid and the lower body of a tailed aquatic creature. The upper body, although humanoid in nature, is distinct in several ways: the skin color often matches harmoniously with the coloring of the tail, black sclera, finned ears, prominent gills, atypical nose structures, and webbed hands. 

Although capable of breathing in oxygen from the air, their bodies are not built to withstand consumption of oxygen in this manner for long periods of time. 

Additionally, mermaids who are out of water for too long can risk drying out, causing lasting damage to their fins and tail. Mermaids are known to have a lifespan of about 50-60 years.

Mermaids can primarily be found living in pods together in large, open bodies of water. 

Some mermaids can also be found living amongst greater society—particularly in towns and cities that are either underwater or feature prominent waterways as a part of the infrastructure.
