Native to [[A'lune]], werewolves have three forms—a human-like form with wolf ears and tail, a completely wolf form, and a monstrous werewolf form. 

Werewolves can switch from their human-like form and their wolf form at ease, but their werewolf only occurs doing full moons. However, if the werewolf is strong enough, they can enter their werewolf form regardless of the time and conditions. They also have alpha/beta/omega designations amongst themselves. 

Werewolves are capable of using #moon magic. They are weak against silver.
#### Lycans

Half werewolves, more commonly referred to as **Lycans**, have two forms—their human-like form with wolf ears and tail and their werewolf form. However, this werewolf form only comes out during full moons. 

They do not have alpha/beta/omega designations. They are also not weak against silver.

#### Designations 

There are three designations amongst werewolves, sometimes also thought of as secondary sexes

**Alpha**: protector inclined hindbrain. afabs of this designation are also intersex with the ability to impregnate.
- associated with traits such as: headstrong, aggressive, dominating

**Beta**: peacemaker inclined hindbrain.
- associated with traits such as: placid, stable

**Omega**: comforter inclined hindbrain. amabs of this designation are also intersex with the ability to get pregnant. 
- associated with traits such as: motherly, peaceful, submissive

These traits, although common enough to warrant the stereotypes, are not indicative of a person's designation as everyone is their own individual and unique person and people vary in degree to how in-tune they are with their hindbrains.
##### Scents

Each designation also comes with notable "scents". Each person has a scent that is unique to them, but generally speaking scents will fall into a general category based on the designation of a person.

**Alpha**: traditionally "masculine" scents (wood, metal, spice, etc.)

**Beta**: uniquely "scentless" relative to alpha and omegas. although they do have a scent, their scents are much more muted and subtle in both strength and flavor

**Omega**: traditionally "feminine" scents (flowers, fruits, cookies, etc.)

**Pup**: definitively milky in nature and do little to reveal what designation that child might turn into.

##### Pups

Upon birth, the designation of an individual is unclear. until the time that a person presents, they are referred to as a "pup".

Pup scents are definitively milky in nature and do little to reveal what designation that child might turn into.

When the designation of a person is revealed, the event is known as "presenting". this term can be further specified into two events that cause the presentation of a designation: presenting heat and presenting rut.

#### Heat / Rut

Both of the aforementioned events usually take place around the time a pup hits the age of 13-16.
##### Presenting Events
###### Heat

A presenting heat is a more mild version of a regular heat. The person's hindbrain will not completely take over as is typically in full heats. 

This presenting heat typically lasts anywhere from 3-5 days. Presenting heats lack any of the sexual elements and feelings that come with a full heat. As this is an excruciating event to go through alone, family is typically there to help a person through their presenting heat. 

Most families will simply be a comforting presence to the presenting person by staying in the nest with them and helping to feed, hydrate, and clean the person. By the end of the presentation heat, the person will have lost their pup scent in exchange for an omega scent fitting of their new designation.

###### Rut

A presenting rut is a more mild version of a regular rut. 

The person's hindbrain will not completely take over as is typically in full ruts. This presenting rut typically lasts anywhere from 3-5 days. 

Presenting ruts lack any of the sexual elements and feelings that come with a full rut. Given that ruts, even presenting ruts, tend to lead themselves to bouts of aggression and possessiveness, those going through presenting ruts are typically left alone (family can also choose to spend the presenting rut with the person, which sees the presenting person be of clear mind. However the aggression and possessiveness will rear its head when family members attempt to leave the person's sight). 

Family can help be a source of comfort through the sharing of items. By giving the presenting person items—typically clothes—that have the family's scent well-worn into them, the aggression and possessiveness abates into a much more manageable level, letting the presenting person to have a more clear head. 

By the end of the presentation rut, the person will have lost their pup scent in exchange for an alpha scent fitting of their new designation.

###### Beta Event

Betas uniquely lack any type of presenting event. instead, their scent will subtly change from milky to the signature subtle scent of a beta over time. 

(so basically, if you don't have a presenting heat or rut by the time you're 17, you're either a beta or an alpha/omega late bloomer).

#### Post-Presenting 

After these presenting events, heats and ruts will occur about 4 times a year.

Although there is no verbal/colloquial distinction between the two, there are actually two different types of heat/ruts that happen after the initial presenting event.

The first is an adolescent heat/rut, although this is simply referred to as a heat/rut. in practice, it is a presenting heat/rut in everything but name. 

These are the type of heats/ruts that follow the presenting one. These events will remain the person's normal until the age of 18-20.

At age 18-20, adolescent heats/ruts involve into mature heats/ruts, also simply referred to as a heat/rut. These are heat/ruts taken to their full extent with an added sexual element and feelings that are not present in adolescent heats/ruts. 

These events can either be resolved sexually (omegas needing the feeling of a knot and alphas needing the feeling of popping a knot) or through the same way adolescent heats/ruts are dealt with. 

If choosing to deal with the event the same way you would an adolescent heat/rut, the sexual element and feelings will abate, but the discomfort of the full condition of a mature heat/rut will remain, as will the prominence of the person's hindbrain—there are little to no "clear mind" moments to be had regardless of familial presence in contrast to adolescent heats/ruts.
