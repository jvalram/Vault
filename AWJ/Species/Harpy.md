Native to [[Hava]], Harpies are creatures that have wings for arms, a feathery plume of a tail, and calves/feet of a bird. 

Powerful air magic users, they live in small communities in areas typically inaccessible to those without air magic. 

They generally prefer to not involve themselves with humans, but their relationship with humans is fine. 

They're known to be ruthless warriors when it comes to combat, but are generally impassive outside of the battlefield.
#### Oscen
Half harpies are known as "Oscen" 

Appearance wise, they appear as somewhat of a traditional angelâ€”a human body with typically large wings growing out from their backs. 

Splotches of plumes can be found across their bodies, much like bird familiars in their hybrid forms.
