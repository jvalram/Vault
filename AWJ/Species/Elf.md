Native everywhere, Elves are graceful and powerful beings that appear human but have long, pointed ears. 

Unlike humans, all elves have the ability to perform magic. They can use every type of magic except for light and dark magic. 

Elves are typically tall in stature, the range for height being around 6'-6'5". They typically live to be about 300-350 years old.

Elves are followers of the [[Velesteus Doctrine]] and believe themselves to be created in Velesteus's image. Due to this belief, elves tend to have a particular dislike for [[Velekin|Velekins]] as they claim the same idea. 

They are an extremely proud species due to their belief, believing that because they were created in [[Velesteus]]'s image that they are the rightful rulers of all of [[Mulvao]], much to the vehement disagreement of anyone who isn't an elf.

Before the events of [[World's Calamity]], elves lived in both their own exclusive communities and in non-elven societies, much to the chagrin of those in said societies as elves were notorious for preaching their evident superior capabilities to all that would listen.
