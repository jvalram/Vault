Native to [[A'lune]], vampires are powerful magical creatures with an affinity for mind magic that come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the variant of vampire. 

Regardless of variant, they possess notably sharp fangs that can easily pierce through skin. All vampires skin appears a natural shade when properly satiated. However, the skin tone of a vampire will begin rapidly paling to sickly and inhuman levels the more starved a vampire becomes. 

Vampires are susceptible to burning when coming into direct contact with sunlight or sun magic to varying degrees depending on type. They will also burn if they come into physical contact with silver (the type of silver depends on the variant) and holy water. 

However, vampires are immune to offensive #moon magic and doubly receive the boons of restorative moon magic.

Vampires age until a point of full maturity at which point the aging process ceases for eternity.

Vampires are well-known for their timeless aging. If left be, a vampire can live for an eternity. Vampires can be killed, but depending on the variant of vampire, the process of killing a vampire can be complex. 

Vampires are also to known to have fast regeneration capabilities so any attempts to strike one down should be a strike to kill, not wound. 

All vampires require the consumption of a sentient species' blood in order to sustain their living.

There are two known variants of vampires: **Legacy** and **Sired**.
#### Legacy Vampires

Legacy vampires are those born as vampires. 

Spawned into existence as a part of the wish for chaos that began [[World's Calamity]], the original Legacy vampires were completely devoid of morality and reason. They merely existed to cause as much chaos and destruction. 

To this end, cursed Legacy vampires are uniquely able to to use #dark magic in addition to #mind magic. It should be noted that Legacy vampires are unique from other cursed monsters in that through generations, younger cursed Legacy vampires have regained some reasoning capabilities, allowing them to organize into covens to coalesce power and create impactful schemes.

As Legacy vampires, they can also transform into a bat at will. They also have a unique ability to evade death if given the opportunity. 

When a Legacy vampire is struck with a killing blow or comes into contact with a lethal dose of a weakness, instead of dying, the Legacy vampire will shatter into a colony of bats—anywhere from 20-50 bats depending on how strong the vampire is. 

Each of these bats is an equal part of the vampire, consciousness split between them all. If the bats are able to make their way to a cold, dark, isolated place in under an hour, they will coalesce and form a cocoon of sorts, allowing the vampire to fully reform inside. 

If all of the vampires bats make it in time to coalesce, the regeneration process usually takes about 1-2 days. For every bat that doesn't make it back though, the regeneration process is set back anywhere from 1-5yrs. 

If no bats make it within the time limit, they will simply expire and the Legacy vampire will meet their final end. 

The only type of death that will not trigger this unique evasion is a killing blow struck by anyone with a blood connection to the Legacy vampire, whether it be through kinship or the vampire's own Sired vampire.

Legacy vampires, unlike their Sired variants, have an enhanced physical prowess along with incredible speed.

Legacy vampires are the most susceptible to direct sunlight or sun magic, instantly burning. Cursed Legacy vampires are able to reproduce with other cursed monsters. 
##### Exorcised Legacy Vampires

Exorcised Legacy vampires are the result of a cursed Legacy vampire being exorcised. 

Although these types of Legacy vampires appear to be of a more sound mind than their cursed Legacy vampires and lose their ability to use dark magic, they still pose an active threat to society by necessity of their diet. 

These types of Legacy vampires tend to be in present in equal amount to their cursed counterparts. 

When dealing with an original cursed Legacy vampire, exorcism can oftentimes be the less complex solution to permanently dispatching of them. However, mistakes and misinformation will occasionally cause exorcists to perform exorcisms on a cursed Legacy vampire who isn't an original, leaving the targeted Legacy vampire in an exorcised state. 

Additionally, it's believed that some younger cursed Legacy vampires may also risk intentionally having themselves exorcised in order to achieve the full ability to reason in order to strengthen their covens and schemes.

Legacy vampires have an appearance nearly identical to those of humans, half elves, and elves with the unique distinction of fanged teeth and black sclera. Curiously, it has been noted that the reflections of Legacy vampires are non-existent on any reflective surface. 

Exorcised Legacy vampires are able to reproduce with sentient species.


#### Sired Vampires

Unique to Legacy vampires is the ability to turn other people into vampires, of whom are referred to as "Sired" vampires. 

This can be done by allowing a person to drink the blood of a Legacy vampire. Sired vampires can become Legacy vampires upon the consumption of their creator's heart. 

Sired vampires are those that are created from drinking the blood of a Legacy vampire. Most sentient species are capable of becoming Sired vampires (the exceptions being: sprites, gensai, dryads, nymphs). 

They are created in a cursed state regardless of whether the Legacy vampire who created them is cursed or exorcised. However, being fed the blood of their creator allows them to gain complete reasoning capabilities for up to 72 hours. Additionally, consumption of their creator's blood is a viable substitute of sentient species' blood for nutrition.

Sired vampires are incapable of creating more Sired vampires—only a Legacy vampire can create Sired vampires. They are infertile, forever incapable of biologically producing offspring.

Upon conversion, those who have any affinity for any other type of magic aside from #mind find themselves cut off from improving upon that affinity, but retain whatever magic spells they were able to perform before conversion in addition to gaining mind magic at a beginner's level (in the case of a dual-user being converted, both non-mind magic types are cut off from the user and replaced with mind magic). 

Those who already have an affinity for mind magic retain their capabilities. Those who posses no magic are gifted with the affinity for mind magic upon conversion.

Sired vampires are much more resistant to direct sunlight and sun magic, able to withstand direct contact with only itching as a symptom for about 3 hours before burning occurs. A rest period of an hour is usually enough for a Sired vampire to recover and be subjected to sunlight or sun magic again. 

When exorcised, Sired vampires completely lose their vampirism and revert back to their original species. In addition, those who were cut off from native magic types regain those magic types. 

However, If mind magic use was gained through becoming a Sired vampire, that magic affinity is removed (along with dark magic) upon successful exorcism. Time and age will resume for the ex-vampire from the time of exorcism as the ageless time spent as a vampire acts as a stasis for age.

#### Dhampirs

Half vampires are categorically referred to as "dhampirs". 

They are typically subject to the sharp vampiric fangs capable of drawing blood, but can also sometimes inherit the [[black sclera]].

They have none of the weaknesses that vampires do, yet possess the potential to have a strength, agility, and magical ability on par with full vampires. 

However, consumption of blood is required for tapping into this potential. These boons are temporary and the length of effect is determined by how much blood is consumed. 

Dhampirs are able to process the consumption of blood as a valid nutritional source, but it is not necessary for sustenance.
#### Covens

Typically, vampires as a species are known to cluster in organizations referred to as "Covens". 

Covens are usually lead by a family of Legacy vampires with a majority of its manpower coming from Sired vampires created by the head family. These organizations range vastly in size, typically anywhere from 20-250 members.

Covens provide both support and resources to their members, often going out in group hunts or coming to each other's rescue when able. The most security a coven provides its members are a guarantee of blood as covens take care of their own, making them a popular choice for vampires not confident in their ability to hunt for their own blood.

They are also popular choices amongst powerful vampires as the structural hierarchy covens often provide stronger vampires the opportunity to work with other strong vampires to completely dominate areas they'd be unable to on their own—all while receiving social and hierarchal power for it.

Covens have always tended to be extremely secretive about their existence outside of the vampiric community, but the secrecy has increased tenfold ever since vampires were placed on the International Monster Listing.
