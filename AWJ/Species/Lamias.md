Native to [[Erzeung]] and [[Klorída]], Lamia are creatures with a serpent's body and the torso, arms, and head of a human—albeit with snake-like traits such as a forked tongue, slit eyes, and fangs. 

**Depending on the type of lamia, these fangs can also carry deadly venom.** The easiest way to tell if a lamia's bite will be venomous or not is to check the scaling pattern of the Lamia. For the most part, the scale patterns of lamia tend to match-up with the scale patterns of snakes. 

Some lamia have living snakes as as hair. These lamia have the special ability to paralyze opponents just by making eye contact with them. 

If the lamia is strong enough in their magical abilities, the lamia can even turn their opponent into any type of material—stone, gold, etc. 

All lamia lay eggs and hatch from them. Lamia are also capable of impregnating other species through means of laying eggs into their partner. When conceived through this way, the child will always hatch a lamia, but there is a 1:5 chance that the child will inherit a single magical affinity from the non-lamia parent.

They are typically solitary creatures, preferring to live in cave systems and mountainous areas. This especially true for the lamia of Erzeung due to the species as a whole harboring negative feelings for witches and humans as a whole.

**Lamias have an affinity for** #earth, #mind, and #creation **magic.**
