If a soul dies with "too much" regret/unfinished business, that soul will linger on Mulvao as a Ghost instead of returning to the reincarnation flow immediately.

The longer the ghost is on Mulvao, the odds of it mutating/evolving into a [[Wraith]]/[[Specter]] increase.

As ghosts, they simply appear as wispy faded versions of their corpses. 

Wraiths (and Specters) are essentially stronger versions of ghosts, with Wraiths gaining the ability to use dark magic. 

Ghosts, Specters, and Wraiths are all immortal-ish. At the source, all three can be dealt with by fulfilling their regret/unfinished business, allowing their souls to move on into the reincarnation flow. 

Ghosts/Specters go to [[Velesteus]].

Wraiths go to the void, never to be reincarnated again unless [[Asmotheus]] was particularly impressed with the Wraith. 

Of the three, Ghosts are the most common.
