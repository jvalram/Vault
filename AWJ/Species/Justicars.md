Justicars are the embodiment of "justice" 

They are powerful beings gifted in the ancient #light magic. They are bound by their duty to enact justice upon those who promote chaos and immorality and are incapable of performing any action not directly dealing with these concepts.

Current day, Justicars are seldom seen outside of [[A'lune]]. Even within A'lune, their numbers are small. 

Scholars believe the lack of Justicars can be attributed to two simple facts. The first being that Justicars do not reproduce. The second being that no new Justicars have been spawned into existence since the end of [[World's Calamity]]. 

Whenever a particularly nasty outbreak of powerful demons happens anywhere in the world, Justicars are typically quick to arrive and just as quick to leave when the demon population settles into more manageable levels. 

No one knows where exactly Justicars come from or where they leave to. Some believe the dragons of old created them whereas others believe them to be soldiers of the creator god Velesteus. 

Justicars do not appear to settle down within any types of civilizations as they seem to constantly be on the move with a purpose.

Justicars are impervious to age and disease. The only way they die is by being killed.
