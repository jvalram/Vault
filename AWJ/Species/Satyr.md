Native to [[Klorída]], Satyrs are gentle but powerful creatures that frolic deep within the magical forests of Klorída.

They sport horns, fluffy ears, hooves, a fluffed tail, horizontal pupils, furred lower bodies, arms, necks, and sometimes furred chests. They are known to be graceful creatures who enjoy the delights of life and carry a strong appreciation for music.

They live in small groups known as "troops" and can often be found playing an instrument carved from trees around them. 

Satyrs have an affinity for #flora and #earth magic.
