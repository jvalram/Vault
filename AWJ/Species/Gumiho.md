Native to Pensier, Gumihos are powerful magical creatures that hold an affinity for #mind magic. 

They appear humanlike in appearance with the exception of fox ears, fox tails ranging anywhere from 1-9 in number, sharper canines, claw-like nails, and vertically slit pupils. 

**When born, all gumihos start at 9 tails**. Gumihos are uniquely able to harness the immense amounts of magical energy stored in these tails to revive themselves when killed. 

**Upon a revival, a tail will dissipate into magical energy that goes straight into the gumiho**. Permanent death awaits gumihos on their last tail. 

Gumihos age until a point of full maturity at which point the aging process ceases for eternity.

**Gumihos are entirely carnivorous** with an appetite for one thing: the fresh flesh of sentient beings. 

To enable this diet, they possess the ability to both **transform** and **glamour**. Every gumiho is able to transform into a fox at will for an unlimited amount of time. The amount of tails this fox form has will correlate with the amount of tails they naturally possess unless glamoured to appear otherwise. 

They are also able to glamour themselves to both appear and physically mimic the appearance of any sentient being for as long as they please. However, being physically hurt past a certain threshold will dispel the glamour.

There are two known variants of gumihos: **Cursed** and **Exorcised**.

#### Cursed Gumiho

**Cursed gumihos are the most common type of gumihos.** 

Spawned into existence as a part of the wish for chaos that began World's Calamity, **cursed gumihos are completely devoid of morality and reason. They merely exist to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible.** To this end, cursed gumihos are uniquely able to use dark magic in addition to mind magic.

Cursed gumihos are only able to reproduce with other cursed monsters.

#### Exorcised Gumiho

**Exorcised gumihos are the result of a cursed gumiho being exorcised.** 

Although these types of gumihos appear to be of a more sound mind than their cursed siren counterparts and lose their ability to use dark magic, they still pose an active threat to society by necessity of their diet. 

However, by **successfully going through the process of Enlightenment, an exorcised gumiho can become an enlightened kitsune.** 

The specifics of Enlightenment vary from source to source, but it is generally agreed that Enlightenment occurs when an exorcised gumiho has a genuine change of heartâ€”a process that significantly ends in more apparent failures than successes. 

Exorcised gumihos are able to reproduce with sentient species.
