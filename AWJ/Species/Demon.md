Demons are evil beings of chaos. They are spawned into existence by the Chaosbringer, [[Asmotheus]] but can also come about as a result of a person losing themself or becoming cursed and demons reproducing with each other. They come in many forms, shapes, and sizes but are all ultimately made up of refined #dark magic energy. 

Upon being killed, their bodies quickly begin to disintegrate into dark magic energy that coalesces into a ball that violently shoots outwards once done charging, infecting anything it touches in the immediate surrounding.

Those believing of the [[Velesteus Doctrine]] believe demons to be [[Asmotheus|Asmotheus's]] soldiers. Demons are the embodiment of chaos and immorality. 

Demons plague the world everywhere, but are noted as having a higher population density in A'lune. This is thought to be the case as A'lune is the origin point of the creation of demons per the events of World's Calamity.

Demons are impervious to age and disease. To completely destroy a demon, one must either kill it or exorcise it. Upon being killed, their bodies quickly begin to disintegrate into dark magic energy that coalesces into a ball that violently shoots outwards once done charging, infecting anything it touches in the immediate surrounding. 

A killing blow of moon magic, a containing shield of moon magic, or enough of blessed water or any blessed item being thrown onto the demon will prevent the dispersion of dark magic. 

Successfully performing an exorcism ritual on a demon will not only kill the demon safely, but convert their dark magic energy into light magic energy that will disperse outwards into the immediate surrounding, nourishing all. 

If one wishes to harvest parts of a demon that wont dematerialize, the part needs to be removed from the main body of the demon while it is still alive. In doing so, any parts of the demon removed prior to its death will stay tangible instead of disintegrating into dark magic energy.

#### Resurgence

After the events of the [[World's Calamity]], demons were seemingly eradicated into extinction. The peace of such a revelation was unfortunately short-lived, demons quickly came back into the world. 

The first generation of new demons are thought to have spawned from people who lost themselves to madness, grief, or rage as the dust of the World's Calamity settled. Ever since then, demons continue to spawn as a result of people losing themselves, getting cursed, getting possessed, and demons reproducing with each other.

Despite the combined efforts of Justicars, magic users, and warriors alike to eradicate the new wave of post-World's Calamity demons, the problem of demons persists to this day.

The problem of demons persists to this day, but Mulvao is much more equipped to deal with itâ€”a fact that is especially evident in a popular career choice amongst [[A'lune|A'lunians]]: demon hunters
