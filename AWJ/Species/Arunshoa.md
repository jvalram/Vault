Closely associated with [[Sesur-sati]], as the arunshoa (along with [[Pharaoh Pashet|Pashet]] and the [[Anunoth]] guided the people and allowed them to storm and slay Sesur-sati, putting his tyrannical reign to an end.  

As Sesur-sati's corpse shattered into a flux of magical sun energy, the [[Peaqui]], [[Anunoth]], and [[Arunshoa]] took some of the free energy and blessed Pashet.
