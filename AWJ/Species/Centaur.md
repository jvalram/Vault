Native to [[Terra]], centaurs are creatures easily recognizable by their human appearance from the torso up and their equestrian appearance from the waist down. 

Among centaurs, there are two largely recognized subtypes: **Wild** and **City**.
#### Wild Centaurs

Wild centaurs live out in the uninhabited plains of Terra in herds. Each herd has its own unique hierarchy system, each one led by a **Chief**. 

**The Chief position is typically held by the strongest centaur in the herd**. Any offspring is kicked out of the herd between the ages of 10-20. 

Parents of exiled offspring are not opposed to interacting with offspring after they've been exiled, but will show hostility to their offspring if they're found to have been attempting to reconnect with anyone else in their parents' herd. 

Each tribe has their own specific markings that each member of the herd has painted on at all times. Each marking has its own unique and specific meaning to the tribe it originates from.

**They are known to be incredibly hostile to other centaur herds.** A moment in which a wild centaur herd knows peace is practically nonexistent as if there is no battle being had, a centaur herd will actively seek one out. 

Across all wild centaur herds, a culture of highly coveting power and dominance exists. These battles have been observed to be excessively bloody and brutal, oftentimes ending in the complete execution of the losing herd or a forceful absorption of the survivors of the losing herd. 

**It is typical for the Chief of the losing herd to be eaten raw by all members of the winning herd, starting with the winning Chief.** Skulls of the herd that lost are another common trophy. 

Centaurs typically string the skulls of the enemies they've killed onto a sash or belt. The more skulls one wears on them, the more respect they are typically shown. The winning Chief gains the honor of claiming the losing Chief's skull regardless of who killed the Chief.

In the distant past, wild centaurs were known to extend this brutal hostility to all indiscriminately. However, ever since the truce that ended the "[[Centaur Wars]]", wild centaurs exclusively harm other wild herds. 

Any non-centaur soul who runs into a centaur herd will merely be directed back to the closest village/city/town.
#### City Centaurs

City centaurs, as their name suggests, are a common part of the greater [[Terra]] society, living among the general population in villages, towns, and cities. The city subtype of centaurs can be traced back to the [[Centaur Wars]].

**Unlike their wild counterparts, they wear clothes and enjoy actively participating in a grander society.** These centaurs do not have herds. Instead, they adhere to the typical concept of a family unit. 

This concept also applies to the way they treat their offspring, having no hard rules on exiling them at a certain age. Another notable difference that city centaurs have from their wild counterparts shows in their diet. **While wild centaurs are known to be omnivores, city centaurs are herbivores.** 

In society, many city centaurs easily find work in physical jobs thanks to their physical prowess. However, compared to their counterparts, the physical strength they hold is significantly less. 

Another decent portion of city centaurs choose to live their lives as adventurers. Unlike their counterparts, **city centaurs are able to carry and balance a person on their back's if they so choose, lacking the extreme aversion to it that wild centaurs have.**
