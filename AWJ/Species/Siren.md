Native to [[Shu«êeh]], **Sirens are powerful magical creatures that hold an affinity for both water and mind magic.** 

They are easily distinguishable by their more familiar appearance. They possess the upper body of a humanoid and the lower body of a tailed aquatic creature. 

Unlike mermaids, the upper body of sirens are mostly identical to that of humans with the exception four traits: random patches of scales that match those on their tail (however, some sirens lack these patches of scales), the same finned ears mermaids have, gills along their throats, and colored sclera with no discernable iris or pupil. 

This primarily shared physiology between the upper torse of a siren and human also allows sirens to uniquely process oxygen from both the air and water without issue. However, sirens are still at risk of drying out their fins and tails if left dehydrated for too long.

**Sirens are entirely carnivorous with an appetite for one thing: the fresh flesh of sentient beings**. To enable this diet, sirens have two unique abilities that mermaids lack: the ability to glamour and the ability to perform what has been dubbed a "Siren's Call"

When beached, sirens can glamour their appearance to both appear and physically mimic the appearance of any sentient being. However, this magic does have it's limit: 24 hours. Beyond this time, the glamour will dispel and leave a siren stuck in its true form and unable to cast another glamour until the siren has properly rehydrated their entire body. 

Among sirens, two types exist: **cursed** and **exorcised**.
#### Cursed Sirens

Cursed sirens are the most common type of sirens. 

Spawned into existence as a part of the wish for chaos that began [[World's Calamity]], cursed sirens are completely devoid of morality and reason. They merely exist to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible. 

To this end, cursed sirens are uniquely able to use #dark magic in addition to #water and #mind magic. 

Cursed sirens are only able to reproduce with other cursed monsters. 

#### Exorcised Sirens

Exorcised sirens are the result of a cursed siren being exorcised. 

Although these types of sirens appear to be of a more sound mind than their cursed siren counterparts and lose their ability to use dark magic, they still pose an active threat to society by necessity of their diet. 

Exorcised sirens are able to reproduce with sentient species.

Exorcised sirens tend to be harder to come by as hunters are much more likely to simply dispatch of a cursed siren than take the time, effort, and risk to perform an exorcism. 

Typically, exorcised sirens only come into their new status from being the successful target of exorcists-in-training.
#### Siren's Call

The "Siren's Call" is an ability that allows sirens to use their voices to charm and hypnotize any who hear it. 

To this effect, sirens also possess incredibly powerful diaphragms that allow their voices to project clearly up to 1,200 feet away. When under it's effect, the siren is able to exert complete mental control over the affected. 

Most commonly, this ability is used to lure people into open bodies of water to drown themselves and others, allowing for easy pickings for the sirens hunting.

Sirens have been noted to primarily exist in pod groups out in the open ocean, but there are a notable number of sirens who prefer to hunt solo on land through means of glamouring.
