Velekin are humanoids known for their unique appearanceâ€”blue/purple/green skin, three eyes, pitch black or vibrant galaxy colored sclera with no discernable iris or pupil, two pairs of wings on that sprout from their back, and a small pair of wings in place of ears. 

They are commonly believed to be created in the image of the Maker, [[Velesteus]]. 

Contrary to this belief, velekin do not appear to be naturally inclined towards peace and are unique and varied individuals with their own personalities. 

They are native to [[Aukamen]] as a whole and have an affinity for #creation, #mind, #water, #air, and #flora magic.
