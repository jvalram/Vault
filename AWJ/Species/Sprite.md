Sprites are semi-aware beings made of purely condensed elemental magical energy. They typically manifest as small balls of light that tend to gather in places that contain highly concentrated amounts of elemental magical energy. 

Sprites do not seem to do much besides float in the air and send off short sparks of their own energy when touched. They are often collected and used in potions aimed at restoring magical energy.

> [[Gensai]] are sprites that have absorbed enough elemental magical energy from their surroundings to evolve into a fully sentient and intelligent being.
