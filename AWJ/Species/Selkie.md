Native to [[Shu«êeh]], selkies are powerful and magical creatures that are both human and seal. 

They have a strong, deep connection to the ocean, but retain a curious side to themselves that compel them to take periods of leave from the ocean to walk on land. 

They do this by shedding their seal skin in order to take on a human form. While in human form, they retain all of their magical abilities alongside an enhanced lung capacity, the ability to see clearly underwater in both light and dark with no repercussions, the capacity to speak the selkie tongue, and an enhanced tolerance for higher water pressures. 
#### Selkie Skin

They can take their selkie skin on and off as frequently as they like, but must refresh their magic through attendance of the [[Ocean's Call]] or the selkie skin will lose all of its magic until it is appropriately refreshed by the Ocean's Call. 

Selkie skin can only be removed by the owner willingly removing it. Any attempts to skin a selkie in seal form will simply result in non-magical seal skin, not magical selkie skin. Selkie skin is also special in that it has the ability to tangibly glamour any who partially don it into a witch. 

A centaur who wears the skin would appear and feel fully like a witch. A nymph who wore the skin would look and feel entirely like a witch, not a hint of any water limbs on their person. Additionally, wearing the skin also grants the wearer the ability to use water magic if the ability does not already exist in the wearer. 

If the ability does exist in the wearer already, then the selkie skin serves as an additional source of magic, allowing the wearer to transcend their limits. When the selkie skin is completely slipped into, those who wear it enter the form of a seal, just like a true selkie. 

In order for all of these boons to work, the selkie skin must be in a refreshed state from participation in the Ocean's Call. If the selkie skin dries out from not being refreshed, the selkie skin will lose all of its magic until it is appropriately refreshed by the Ocean's Call. 

Unless the wearer of the selkie skin is a full-blooded waterborne species, the wearer will not hear the Ocean's Call naturally and must find out both when and where the Ocean's Call is for their specific selkie skin. 

Even if the wearer is a full-blooded waterborne species, the selkie skin must be refreshed where the ocean call it, which could potentially cause conflict if the wearer's ocean call is in a different body of water.
#### Half Selkies

Half selkies are essentially equal to a selkie's human form, retaining all the same boons. They can also transform into a seal for a limited amount of time without worry of a seal skin. However, at minimum, this transformation will only last 1 hour (and 8 hrs at max) before the half selkie forcibly reverts and requires a long rest before being able to transform again.
