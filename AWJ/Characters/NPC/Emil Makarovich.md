Emil Makarovich 

current day Emil is 25 

if he gets to live to a certain point, his magic will be strong enough to usurp Cecelia's position as High Witch 

he's a creation witch from Erzeung 

Cecelia has a tendency to seek out her native competition and order hits on them 

Emil got lucky and managed to not die to the first attempt on his life has been hopping around all of Aukamen ever since he managed to escape the initial attempt on his life in Erzeung at age 22 so since he's 25 now he's been on the run since he was 22. 

spent abt 2.5 years hopping around all of Aukamen. even though his life was very much on the line, he really liked the modern living, hence him waiting so long to escape to Braudrica 

i think an attempt that SERIOUSLY almost killed him was the tipping point for him to say bye bye to his moderate (for being on the run) lifestyle and charter a boat to Braudrica 

i don't know where he would've gone though (not Shuieh, despite its modernity)

he realized part of the reason why he kept getting found was his active usage of his device so Shu«êeh is a no go since he wants to be relatively off the grid the most off-grid place he can think of askvadjr but thats way too harsh for a previous city boy the next? 

klorida what is klorida if not just a bunch of forests, right? ahahahaah hes under the impression that everyone there is a religious hippie super 

unlikely that erzeung attack dogs are running amok there, is his logic so he arrives in the port city of Thoregea, Klorida but the fact that its a port makes him nervous lots of international stuff goes on at ports so he prolly works his way up to Semetri, Klorida
