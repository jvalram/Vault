Tanaydin is [[Bedri Saglik|Bedri's]] younger sister. She is a full air witch and has a snow leopard familiar. 

She is the second oldest out of her 5 siblings (excluding her). Ever since Bedri left, she has taken up the role of chief, learning right alongside her father until she is prepared enough to fully take the role over from him. 

On top of her duties, she is also the primary caretaker of her younger siblings, as her father is too busy and her mother is often away from home as a diplomat.

She is currently in a relationship with [[Dianthus Carnation]] and has recently been invited to come study at the Conlegium in Pensier.
