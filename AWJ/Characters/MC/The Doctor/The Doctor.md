The Doctor, formerly known as Masami Fukuda, was once a renown surgeon in one of [[Shuǐeh]]'s more backwater districts.

## History
Masami Fukuda was once a renown surgeon in [[Xuangong]], [[Shuǐeh]] – [[Tsentooroi]]

During her time at the facility, a poor family had been quietly observing her for a few months, taking note of her extensive abilities and the respect others had for her within her profession. The family had a daughter with a disease they couldn't find the name of and no money to support her. They were afraid their options were to either let her die, or leave her with someone who they felt would never stop fighting for her. 

On a dark and thunderous night, Masami answered a gentle knock on her door to find a baby at her doorstep. 

Prior to this, Masami had very little time for romance in her life and had never planned on raising a family, yet couldn't seem to stop herself from caring for the child and adopting her as her own. 

Fukuda Masami would become the child's name and for around 3 years, the two were a perfect match. Fukuda had warmed Masami's cold and professional exterior and pulled her away from her former 72 hour hospital shifts. Fukuda was the reason Masami learned to enjoy the parts of her life that didn't involve cutting people open. 

Once Fukuda turned 3, there was clearly something very wrong. The girl grew sicker by the day. It was only cold symptoms at first. Then flu. Then complete deterioration. Masami used all resources. Every test, possible diagnosis, possible treatment. All resulted in nothing. 

First, her lungs began to fail. The doctor wasted no time in finding a viable donor, and with her age she took priority. Then her kidney. Then her liver. Masami became extremely protective of the girl, breaking hospital protocol to treat her own child. 

Using her water magic, Masami extended the longevity of her organs, just hoping to buy time to figure out what was wrong. 

Nearly three years of extensive research, different treatment plans, medication, surgeries. The child had almost every possible organ operated on, replaced, removed, with the liver taking multiple transplants, each one pushing the girl further down the list. 

She had spent nearly half of her life, and all of her life she could remember, being horribly in and bedridden. The doctor would try her best to take her outside, to see the Ocean, to watch the sun rise and set. All signs pointed to impending death. 

Masami was deeply in denial of this, insisting to her peers that there was still hope for Kohaku. They cut her off from using hospital resources, assuming Masami would eventually listen to them or at the very least, go to a different hospital and receive the news from them. Masami did not go to a new hospital, nor did she stop fighting. 

With no new donors, Masami began to extend the longevity of the organs within already dying patients, then performing extraction procedures on their cadavers to remove the viable organ and doing off book surgeries on Fukuda to replace her sick organs with the viable. 

This worked for another year, but eventually the only failing organ left was the girls heart. It's impossible to extend the longevity of the heart in a dying patient as a beating heart means the patient is alive, meaning Masami wouldn't be able to remove it from them after death. Her desperation had driven her to something close to madness. 

Masami decides to take a comatose patient and do an off record live heart transplant. The operation fails and she's left with two corpses. The death of her daughter triggers a psychotic break and Masami begins to uncontrollably attack the now dead comatose patient. One of her peers enters the room to ensure its ready for an upcoming surgery and sees her, running to call security. 

The doctor tries to make a run for it, taking a hit from a security guard using a water attack that blasts off most of the skin on the left side of her face. There's no time as she's running to heal her destroyed flesh, but the doctor does her best to repair her damaged eye as she avoids attacks from the police forces that have raided the building. 

She manages to slip past, running through the city until she reached [[Terra]]'s border. Masami finds a coyote to smuggle her across, paying well to rush her through before news reached. 

Once she enters Terra, she runs into a gang of muggers (who speak common) that target her on account of her still wearing her doctors uniform (ignoring the blood). She notices a dark stripe on one of the muggers fingernails and, despite having already accepted her death, lets the man know he should get checked for skin cancer. The gang takes note of her uniform again and kidnaps her so she can check it out herself. 

Masami tells them its a subungual melanoma that is easy to tread with extraction and that at most, she will have to remove the fingernail but needs surgical tools (and if possible, a numbing agent) to perform the operation. They would need to check in monthly to ensure the growth hasn't returned. Masami also informs them that they're very lucky it was caught early, or honestly lucky it was caught at all. Subungual melanomas have a 95% survival rate if caught early. 

The gang is extremely grateful to her and they offer to recruit her. She becomes the gangs doctor and lives good, makes good money, and gets protection and respect, officially becoming the gangs doctor. 

Because it took so long before Masami was free to treat her facial wound, the scar on the left side of her face is now permanent. 

After 4 years in Terra, Masami becomes fluent in Terran.
